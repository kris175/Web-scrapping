0,"i think also  is a defacto waiting room, but the more general the merrier!  model 3 lr, black interior, midnight silver exterior order date: 08/11 vin / edd: n/a location: nsw",0
1,"yeah, definitely planning on doing that. i'm also spending way too much time on the tesla forums on whirlpool, and he mentioned to me there that until you have a vin there's no benefit.",0
2,i ordered on the same day with the same colors. the only difference mine is lr. i wonder who is going to get vin first,0
3,"i would expect to first see a hidden vin in the first weeks of january (use the  if you don't have it already) - once you have a car allocated presumably then the slightly more specific dates start appearing, and from what i hear shifting around all the time until much closer to delivery.   i'm sure the next few months will fly by, but man it would've been nice to have the new car over the summer break! whenever it comes there'll be plenty of time to enjoy it i guess.   but we're not on these forums to be patiently waiting, we're here to speculate and second guess and try to will our cars into coming sooner! ",0
4,"just the ""blank"" rego papers, or complete ones with vin etc? i got the former the day i ordered, but not sure what the benefit is for them having half complete rego papers? maybe they can fill in the rest once i have paid and i don't have to do it again.",0
5,"woo! i just got a call from my sa, there was a cancellation and i'm getting a car on the 29th. i could've had it this week (23-24th) but with family christmas stuff that was going to be too complicated so i sacrificed a few days.  (order date was 8/11 - m3 lr, msm/black interior)  edit: i have a delivery date and hidden vin in my account page now.. it's really happening! feels so weird to go from a generic blank page with no estimate to that in the span of an hour.",1
6,wohoo~ congrats mate.  hope few more cancellation pop up   curious to know have you had vin matched before the cancellation reallocation ?,0
7,"no, because i was literally doing my daily check of my account page (yeah, i'm a tragic) when the sa called - she asked if i wanted it this year, or to wait for a 2022 build - i did ask if there was any difference, seeing if she's say anything about the computer, but she just said it's already got the new battery pack going into the '22 models. of course i accepted her offer. she then negotiated the delivery appointment with me via sms after that, and said that she'll get the match sorted out once we'd settled on a date/time. took another 15-30 minutes or so before the delivery appt and hidden vin appeared in my account (i was refreshing every 5-10 min at that point..). no final invoice yet, will see when that comes through.",0
8,"hi all - 1st post  model 3 lr, black interior, midnight silver exterior order date: 16/12 vin / edd: n/a location: gold coast",0
9,"i ordered 10/10/21 and it was showing 1-3 weeks at that time, when i got a vin it changed to 2-6 weeks and it ended up actually being 5 weeks from order.",1
10,"i contacted the sales adviser in late nov and was told;   - january vin assignment  - hopefully february delivery  then first week in dec was told;  - early next year vin assignment  so i am not hopeful. i have waited for custom order audis before, and that was a 6 month plus wait so it is what it is. itâ€™s not as if i would change to any other car anyway   fingers crossed they over deliver. it would be a very positive customer experience them hitting the 8-12 week estimate i was originally provided. so that is key[card]s in hand jan 11 to feb 8.",0
11,"any november orders seeing a hidden vin yet? mine still showing as null. 7 weeks from order date this weekend and my 8-12week estimate is getting closer, fingers crossed for a vin in the next couple of weeks! planning a holiday to airlie beach at easter, driving up from the gold coast. hopefully we will have our tesla by then. also fingers crossed we will see new superchargers at bundaberg (childers) - was estimated for q4 2021, and rockhampton - estimated q1 2022. anyone know if the childers supercharger has been built/ or is in the process of being built yet?",0
12,"you won't get a vin until the car is built (which will likely be early jan), and i wouldn't expect the car until early-mid feb at best.  childers appears to be one of the many q4 2021 pin misses. no-one has spotted a site under construction yet.",0
13,"i wonder what will happen when the ship morning clara departs china, i'm trying to piece together bits of broken up information from a bunch of places i've found over the last year, some have said that a vin will appear (false, as in matched to a vin) when the car is loaded/just after loading/ship has departed...  guess we'll have to tell, the ship is supposed to arrive in shanghai tomorrow (2nd), some posts seem to indicate that ship loading can happen in 24-48hrs and it departs again.  might be worth checking this again later in the week ",0
14,"don't expect to, the tesla purchase experience is similar to buying a phone from telstra. you'll next hear from them once they've assigned you a vin and the issue you an invoice for payment.",0
15,still no vin or ed on our 6/11 order for lr white/white in melbourne. just hoping to get it within the next month... probably optimistic.,0
16,"itâ€™s january! start keeping an eye out for those hidden vins. while i love my car and itâ€™s been fun driving around, and wouldnâ€™t give up my early delivery, i kinda miss that i wonâ€™t have the full hidden vin / ship tracking experience. maybe the next car!",0
17,"i'm watching morning clara on vesselfinder and myshiptracking but the position data is 11 days old. i believe the ship is in shanghai right now about to sail to brisbane, port kembla (for sydney deliveries?) and then melbourne. is there a better way to track ships? if my car is on that ship, when can i expect a hidden vin to appear in the source code? i'm young and very inexperienced in car hunting / ship tracking (ok, not young, but still inexperienced).",0
18," i've seen some reports in 2021 that varies everywhere from hidden vin showed up when loaded to ship left, and others that say they saw nothing until it was basically here already..  considering i expect to take delivery of 3x perf models in q1 hopefully, we'll soon see if it's just random or not.",0
19,"i just received the mail from solar victoria regarding the application for zev subsidy, although there is no vin assigned yet on the account.",0
20,"it's visible for some, not others, and doesn't seem to follow any rhyme or reason. just know you will be contacted when the time comes. and you can do vin checks leading up to that, but don't sweat it if nothing appears for a few more weeks.",0
21,"founds some answers.... looks like all model 3's will get ryzen by around may, until then it's a lotto. you can check with the sales rep once you have a vin and cancel/delay if you like. i probably will to wait for the faster chip.    ",0
22,"when you get your vin assigned reach out to your sa to confirm. the sa won't have access to the system that contains your car's spec, but they have access to someone within tesla that can look up the car's details. this will be the only way to confirm, if last quarter is any guide there will be a lot of wild speculation on the internet that only cars with a vin after xxx or built from x date, most of it will be wrong.  through my sa in late october 2021 i was able to confirm that my car was coming with the 60kwh batttery, the other tesla contact ended up calling me back to confirm over the phone the battery.",0
23,"same here. phone app is now saying 14-20 weeks again. interestingly, when i go to my management page for my order i now have, under my order number, a field for vin which currently lists as n/a. and the edd is back here as well as 14-20 weeks. things are continually changing with regard to information displayed.   ",0
24,  did you install the chrome extension which give you all the information at the bottom of the page? when i installed that it gave me the vin n/a under my reference number too.,0
25,quite possible though there was no mention by  in his announcement that this was part of the extension. looking at his screen dumps you can see the vin field partially scrubbed out.  update: to confirm it is the extension my view of the same page in macos safari does not have the vin field so you are correct.,0
26,dont we need a vin to subscribe?,0
27," you donâ€™t need a vin, but it will help later on. for those joining so far this so year, the focus has been on educating/coaching on what to look for. the focus for the group now is to study shanghai factory videos looking for right hand drive exports. this will then move on to vins, build dates, ships, and estimated delivery dates as the quarter progresses.  others in the group are good at analysing rumours vs facts - particularly on hardware changes.  my advice on whether to subscribe - is only do so now if you want to do a deep dive investigation on when cars in shnghai are being built. if you are just interested in the ships your car is likely on, wait for a vin and build date.",0
28,i have now signed up for the vedaprime service following my order on 16/11. i have to say that the patreon link to discord that he provides is seriously good. most of my questions have now been answered after a single day on discord and the information on shipping and deliveries and how the system works is first class. highly recommended. once my vin arrives i will follow through on the delivery identification service that is also provided.,0
29,"i received a phone call from my sa (to introduce himself) plus text messages plus email/s. this was during the hectic time pre-nsw incentives starting and heaps of vehicles arriving. so maybe i got lucky. but there was no contact until after there was a vin and the various ""online paperwork"" started. he seemed very busy and once or twice i had to do a polite reminder. there were a few issues with logins and stuff which he handled efficiently and effectively. overall, the total experience was excellent and equal to the best in 57yrs of buying cars.",1
30,"just spoke to my tesla rep and was told that they are planning for deliveries in feb 22. was also told that once my model 3 is in transit to oz and processed, i should have a vin assigned which will likely be closer to the end of this month. fingers crossed that we will get no delays!",1
31,my sa also advised that i will be receiving a delivery updates in the coming week or week after (say end of the month). hopefully we will all have a vin by then!,0
32,i was advised today that i should receive vin in the next couple of weeks. not that it sounded like an overly â€˜educatedâ€™ statement. but hereâ€™s hoping! my trade-inâ€™s km are slowly racking up close to the estimated figure i gave and donâ€™t want a drop in value.,0
33,i also got called today from my sa advising late feb early march.  i ordered the rwd in early november in melbourne.  he had no idea about the odds of getting new processor. but whatever i just want the car now haha was told the vin and invoice would be sent in next 2 weeks or so...,0
34,vins will be issued after being built. cars will be built out to about early feb. only the first shipment will be getting their vin first because their car is built. no ships have departed shanghai.,0
35,once you have a vin your sa will be able to call their internal contact to confirm whether your car has the amd chip or not. happy for you to dm me if they tell you otherwise.,0
36,"order date 24/11. just to share some hopes...  just got a courtesy call from my sa. told me that i should expect a vin to be assigned in the next couple of weeks (by the end of jan) and confirmed that the car hasn't been built yet.  when i asked about the chip, he wasn't sure but he did mention that all new cars delivered in china now come with amd, just not sure about au yet since there haven't been any deliveries yet. they will be able to tell when the first car lands. he also indicated that the chips won't be random, as in some cars come with atom while others ryzen. it is decided by the built date. based on the chat, he seemed quite confident with the new chip.  but again, nothing is confirmed so far.",0
37,"so, i just checked with my sa, as i ordered after you 30/11 (if i remember correctly), and a performance, and delivery in sydney. my sa said, he still expects my delivery in 8-12 weeks, (no mention of from ordering date like website says or from now mind you), but i am reading this as delivery before end of march, though 12 weeks would be end of feb...  no amd chip knowledge either, he said they will only know once the cars arrive in country, though i do suspect that's not 100%, there should be a mechanism to match vin to parts, but that might be out of his ability. though i will be pushing him to check this once i get a vin assigned.",0
38," i ordered my m3lr 2 days on 14 nov 2021, 2 days after yours. i got a call a few days ago saying to expect a vin soon. i asked about the amd chip and they said they're not sure as it was being slowly rolled out between now and the end of q2.   once a vin is allocated to the order it should be possible to get a definitive answer about what the car has. seems to me the upgrades are worth cancelling the order and going to the back of the queue for. i only paid $150 for the order fee - which is now $350, however i noted the price of the m3lr has been reduced by $200 from when i ordered it.",0
39,"nobody knows for sure, but late feb/early march is likely. until you're assigned a vin number nobody can say for sure.   i ordered 13 december (rwd) and have been told by a sales agent that the cutoff was 20 december for this quarter's cars. however, that may not hold true for lr and performance models; there was another poster somewhere in this forum who's been told he may be delayed, and he ordered (i think?) a performance earlier than i did in december. the cutoff date may be a little different for each model. let's hope the factory didn't run out of some crucial parts just before building our cars.",0
40,"same, my sa never reached out. i had to send a few emails before tesla called me and told me who my sa was. i sent him a message last friday but no response yet. well it is what it is. just hoping we get a vin by the end of jan.",0
41,"i only had an rn number, infact i still only have the rn number on the page, i got the vin from the chrome extension.",1
42,like wise -- vin can be found in extension,0
43,just now checked my account and i've been assigned a vin starting with lrw ,1
44," correct.. look at source code for lrw  some other sites/forums said to review the source for isnotmatchedtora00vin"" bit.... but mine still says true and has been the whole time even though the vin is actually there today!

56,"interesting that the range change only affects lr. surely there's a logical reason for it not affecting rwd/sr+? advertised ranges sandbagged in advance?  also, no hidden vin for me yet (order details below)",0
57,with vinâ€™s circulating today can anyone confirm that we are about to receive 2022 production models? believe the 10 th letter in the vin should be nâ€¦. thanks,0
58,my vin has tenth letter as n and build date is 10/01/2022,0

74,is anyone who ordered in nov and still haven't got vin yet?,0
75," veda and many others have explained it pretty clearly: orders are built then assigned - not the other way around, if you don't have a vin yet - your combo hasn't been built in sufficient quantities to assign you one.",0
76,"sucks, but it would seems likely that combo isn't being produced in the quantities needed for the current global demand and you've drawn the short straw.  i'm waiting on a white lr and my agent told me that while he had originally assumed i would get it this round, they weren't getting as many as expected and my order was one of the types that was delayed. i'm new to all this, but i have to assume that my combo is also relatively common being white/white lr.   the issue here is that to compare my order date to others would be ignoring things like global demand (this is the australian specific thread so you will be missing a massive amount of data) changes to orders (i changed spec on 20th, which no doubt pushed me back in queue), silent orders (eg those who don't join forums to post info online lol) i can see why veda said this metric isn't really helpful for determining delivery, it has far too many variables.  imho, best to just treat it as a preorder without a date until you get the vin (and join veda's tracking once you do - if you're into that)",0

79,"don't be dramatic,  tesla builds based on demand, and that is based on demand 2 quarters ago (confirmed from veda a few posts ago) and would be specific for your region (lhd vs rhd).  my point is that your order date has a lot of things riding on it and isn't going to be black and white. take mine for instance, which was ordered on 6/12/2021. i've changed from black to white interior on the 20th which would push me back in that sub-queue, and i don't know how this impacts my order in the queue either.  i guess you can compare to others if they share the same spec and around the same order date to get a guideline for yourself, but i would take any date with a pinch of salt until i have a vin personally.",0
80,m3 lr exterior white interior black od 19/11 no vin or notification yet,0
81, od 10/11 lr white/black i have vin and delivery date range listed,1
82,"this is normal with the vin allocation system. it is so amazing, logic does not work. order dates mean very little in this process as i say repeatedly at the beginning of every quarter. it just takes an example to prove it.  my message to people with no vins - hold out for another 3 weeks. if no vin by then reach out to your adviser. waiting for a tesla is an emotional rollercoaster, and there are more curves and ups and downs ahead. delays are ahead for shipping and transporters - as there are every quarter and the estimated delivery dates are untrustworthy and will move a lot.  it is an amazing system. this is why i look at all this closely over last 2 years.",0

120,"just for those asking about lr, i have a white/white lr ordered 6/11 and was one of the first if not the first on here to get a vin and invoice. don't stress if still waiting for your vin, there is no logic behind the order in which people are getting informed of their assigned vins.",0
121,how did you figure out the production date from vin ?,0
122,"lr/rmc/black/aero no fsd, order date was 08/04/21.  got a call from tesla staff 12/21/21 that i needed to answer the ""how are you going to pay?"" question and apply for financing because my car was coming in the next week (no vin).  applied for financing same day, was approved. delivery window got down to 12/29/21 to 12/31/21, no vin ever assigned. car never came.  has been bumped out twice and is now 01/27/22 - 02/24/22. at 5 months wait already i'm relatively confident my reservation is bugged in some way. tesla staff have called me to tell me car was coming in the next week and it didn't. no vin has ever been assigned. people with identical configs who ordered months later are receiving their cars.  if only there was a phone number i could call to figure out what's going on...i'm 20 minutes from the fremont factory they don't even need to deliver it...i'll take an uber...  bonus: credit approval is only good for 30 days. i guess i'll take  hard credit check hit if they ever assign a vin.",0

127,"wow, haha, i wouldn't have thought that to be the case - would have thought it pulls the data from the same place. i just stole it from  () who posted it in this thread earlier. much easier as i can get my vin when out and about on my phone without thinking too hard using this method.",0
128,surely the rest of us must be getting our vins this week! iâ€™m hoping for another round of vin assignments in the next few days. fingers crossed!,0
129,"od: 14 nov 2021, lr blue, no extras.  just got off the phone with tesla sales. i speak with a different person every time as i don't seem to have an sa.   anyway she said edd is now march (not feb) and that all cars on the next shipment will be built in 2022 and have the ryzen chip.   seems consistent with other messages here.  the reason i haven't got the reduced range acceptance is the vin hasn't been assigned yet. apparently vin will be allocated in the next 2 weeks.  fingers crossed!",0

131,fyi this is a good url to get the vin without looking in the source if you have one.    change the rn to your rn and it should show it for you. it showed in there at same time the vin extension found it in the source.,0
132,did you already have a vin or did that happen today too?,0
133,had a hidden vin for about a week,0
134,would it be fair to say that if you do not have a vin yet your tesla is still in shanghai or to be built?,0
135,"i think the only ones with vin's are from november 2021, i have a vin but was lucky enough to get a cancellation. i think they allocated mine from one of the people who ordered in oct-nov, so wouldn't count that as an lr vin from december order.",0
136, my od 13/11. looks like the ones with vin for lr ordered before 12/11.  i agree with the person posted earlier. it's all over the place...,0
137,"i ordered rwd early december, no vin yet for me",0
138,"from my experience so far and i have a long-range with the order finalised on 2 december. i did order earlier but changed the colour.  i have my vin, estimated delivery date, and already paid the invoice. i received the invoice about the time ship left shanghai for australia.  now i have a paid service where i can track ships. but what i suggest you do is keep an eye on the port of shanghai and in particular the picture i have posted. i believe it is here where the teslas are loaded. but you will not know the destination of the ships until they leave port. that should give you a fair indication of the location of your vehicle.  currently, there is a ship heading toward australia from this location. i could be wrong, but i would think that most who have vehicles on the ship would have their vin number and either received an invoice or it is coming very soon.  i wish tesla themselves were more forthcoming on information so as to avoid so much uncertainty among those waiting for vehicles.

139,it's a quiet week for vin assignments .. so far,0

141,ordered 19/11 and still no vin ,0
142,"i ordered an lr red model 3 with a white interior back in nov. within 4 weeks it was ready for payment. sadly my bank was dragging its heels. i asked tesla for an extra 2 days (on top of the week they allow for payment), but they said no. the car was given to someone else, and sure enough, 2 days later i had the cash.   i've since ordered the same model on 1/12 (8-12 week wait quoted at the time). no vin or updates from tesla yet.  i guess on the bright side, now it'll be a 2022 build and hopefully have the ryzen chip. tbh that is a better outcome than getting it a few months earlier.",0
143,why would that not be allocated to somebody waiting for a vin for a similar car? is it old stock with old computer?,0
144,"i don't think they are old tech. what happens is - when someone cancels the order after the vin allocation, the car goes to existing inventory until sa allocate that car to the queue. if you are smart enough to grab it in that narrow window, that car is yours.",0
145,it's heartbreaking waking up each day waiting for the vin and then not receiving it. i only want it so i know the car exists.,0
146,i ordered an msm lr white on 16/11/2021 melbourne delivery. no vin yet. no nothing. not worried as my workmate ordered a tesla last year. same happened to him. he got vin and invoice on same day and delivery 2 days later while all at the same time people were getting vin's and invoices on all sorts of dates. shows there is no logic to the system at all.,0
147,"13/11, lr  yes, no vin  if there is manual allocation of the vin how do they know at tesla they donâ€™t miss orders to allocate to?",0
148,"i sent an email to tesla today via their â€˜leasingpartnerâ€™ address, enquiring about the timeline to receive a vin and then an actual car i wasnâ€™t expecting a quick response but this afternoon someone called and said iâ€™d get a vin later this week and a late-february or early-march delivery m3lr, white/black, ordered 26.11.21",0
149,"itâ€™s a mixed bag of order dates with vins, as expected, from lots of different dates including late december.  it all depends on what has been built or planned to be built in the quarter, confirming order dates mean very little for vin assignment.",0
150,"hi dan  i initially ordered my lr mid-november but changed the color in the first week of december. this apparently changes the order date. i do have the vin and invoice. it is like vedaprime says, some things obviously don't make sense but the next ship from china will only be a week or two behind the first.  also, you may still get your vin any day. has tesla given you an estimated delivery window? this should also give you some indication of whether you're on the first or second ship.  i think, and this is my opinion only, that if you have an estimated two-week delivery window from early february you are most likely on the first ship but if your window goes into march probably more likely on the ship following.",0
151," hi,  no, there is no delivery timeframe in my tesla account. we'll wait. i've seen that some lr got vin at the beginning of the previous week and nothing since then...",0
152,i'm curious if any of lr's people are going to get vin by the end of this week.,0
153,do you get notification via email or text message? or this is something we need to check in account portal?  i have received vin on 17/01 but no invoice has been issued so far.,0
154," yep, i ordered when it showed 8-12 weeks and now 10 weeks later there is still no vin  they started production at the beginning of jan and i can't imagine they have not built enough the most popular lr spec. looks like they've got shitty allocation procedures",0
155,any p's been issued a vin yet? i ordered on 5/12 (p w/b) and was saying 8-12 wks but that reference has vanished the past wk. not quite sure why?,0
156,"yes, i ordered on 5/12, and got the vin assigned on 24/1. base specs white ext/black int, 18"" wheels, etc , melbourne",0
157,in the beginning it was noobie questions prior to finding this forum. then there was a bit of back and forth around inclusions in the 22 model builds like the new ryzen cpu etc. it has all been via text and one phone call. i messaged him this morning to see if he still thought vin assignment would happen this month as i was curious with chinese new year coming up and that country basically goes into shutdown during that time.,0
158,"my sa just called me to say that there had been a bit of a delay at the factory with white interiors. car will still be delivered in march, but i would not see the vin until the 5-7 of feb. iâ€™ve got a white lr with white interior ordered. order date was 19/11.   regards, stephen",0
159,vedaprime did mention vin allocation normally takes a few weeks anyway so it's probably not abnormal that you do not have one yet.,0

221,i ordered on the 30 nov and don't have a vin yet. my understanding from what vedaprime has said is that this isn't really a problem yet. my edd is still 8-12 weeks from order date.,0

225,"i wonder about this too. if vins are assigned randomly and there are more orders than cars, isnâ€™t it possible that any order at any time may go unfilled? for example we know of people in november waiting for a vin while someone in january has one.  extremely bizarre system. iâ€™d be pretty upset if that happened to me.",0

235,welcome to the rabbit hole  did you just get your vin today?,0
236,"from what i can see the midas leaves pk just after midnight which means that cars should start to be processed from tomorrow. i suspect that everyone with a car allocated from the midas has a vin and invoice. so for those without these, this ship has sailed!  the crystal is due in pk on the 13th feb, but for some reason is not leaving brisbane until the 12th... there could be some delay? this timetable fits those who have a confirmed delivery at the end of feb and the beginning of march. it would seem that the vin and invoices if the same process as the midas should already have been allocated. however, let's say things got out of control in china (which i doubt) the allocations you would think would need to be completed by the end of this week.  the problem is as vedaprime has said many times that demand has outstripped supply. too many orders, not enough cars. waitlists all over the world are 3 months or more. tesla is running 1 quarter behind on orders.  i don't know if vedaprime has identified another shipment in march? without giving too much away he/she may at least confirm or deny",0

238,"just got my vin and estimated deliver 23-31 march  edit: total coincidence but literally 5mins after joining the vedaprime service i went from 0 communication from tesla to having a vin, delivery window and payment info its black magic",1
239,"i wish. it has been a standard response from them. ""we'll let you know if there's an update. you should get it really soon"". but i don't blame them. they are doing their job and it's not their job to assign vin or invoice i guess.  m3lr white/black | 19/11/21 | no vin | melbourne",0
240,"thanks for the update. with your order and the post prior (20/12 order date) both getting vins, i hope my rwd order (standard white/black) from 13/12 gets a vin and edd soon too. late march is better than late april; very glad we're finally getting confirmation of mid december orders, and with luck we can all soon relax and get back to ordering accessories we don't really need.",0

253,correct - it is displayed on the final invoice. i received my vin tuesday and pushed sa to get my invoice and received it today.,

255,"i think the vin allocation process has changed maybe to what has been discussed here for q2 judging by my build date being 07/02 and receiving my vin, invoice and requirement to pay on 09/02. either that or i lucked out and it was allocated manually in what seems to be record time.",1

268,"omg, i just found my vin in the source! wasn't there 3 hours ago. so this is a good sign right? ",1
269,it is the 2022 model with build date on 9th jan 2022  hope your vin is coming in the next few days as we can see a lots of vin assigned magically in two days,0
270,i think shanghai tesla made lots of rwd these days. my order date is 9/12/2021. i got my hidden vin on 9/2 wednesday .,1
271,"so, basically, the vins from the ""supposedly"" 3rd ship are being assigned now. but the order dates for lr, for as early as 13/11 (from what i can see), is not been assigned vin yet. and the rwd from a similar date is being delivered next week!  i am outta here. this is frustrating. and coming here regularly to find out i am not being assigned a vin yet and rwd from jan/2022 are being assigned a vin.   (and honestly waiting here doesn't increase my chance of being assigned a vin, does it?). was excited till last week hoping i'll get my car in couple more weeks(according to my sa). it seems like the earliest now would be late march   ",0
272,"probably best if it causes you any undue stress, not worth the mental load. hope you get a vin soon.",0
273,"vin came through around 3am this morning. rwd white/black 19"", edd 24-31 march vin is 515xx so a new one.  i understand its frustrating waiting for a vin, but they come in batches. it looks like rwd was done or is being done, so i expect lr/p is next. join veda for more information, it helps to be in there. i reckon a heap of deliveries will happen end of march. tesla doesn't care about order date etc and it can be really infuriating watching people who ordered a week ago get a vin while you sit around for months!",1
274,hidden vin model 3 rwd - white/black  expected delivery 23rd-31st mar alexandria,1

276,"here in canberra, i was unable to do that last nov when my car was ready. the car was ready but they wouldn't bring it to canberra and lock in a delivery date until i'd paid the final invoice. we didn't have a tesla shop at that point and they were using a 3rd party freight company. possibly that was the reason.   once you have been assigned a vin you will get the final invoice fairly soon. for me, it's maybe a 2-3 week wait from invoice to the latest edd they've given. i just paid for it so i didn't have to worry and had time to clear up any issues if something went wrong.",0
277,"does anyone know if we lr get vin in this quarter? i'm not sure now  from my memory at least half of lr orders here have not got vin (or maybe more than half).  i know ""we expect some more vin to be assigned"" etc. etc. ok, i can see that but they all rwd and there was one day when there were few p",0
278,got exactly the same today around 15.30  edd end of march  edit: vin appeared in the source code. somehow car got more expensive - need to pay extra $11,1
279,"yes, ordering experience is not that exiting as i thought it would be. for some reason they decided to push back both p and lr models. because when ordering i can remember waiting time for p was longer. same now for lr  if calculating actual weeks since my order it is 134 days or 19 weeks. insane  hope other lr here got their vin as well.",0
280,yes got ours just now. edd 27-31 march  vin 517  so agree itâ€™s probably still in china!,1

287,long time lurker. i have my vin and final invoice and ordered from chatswood. anyone ordered from chatswood have a delivery text yet?,1
288,"from what i have observed, vin is revealed in the order of date generally speaking. it might be the case that someone who ordered two days after you might get a vin before you but rest assured someone who ordered an lr 10 days after you wouldn't get a vin before you. i got mine yesterday some time after someone who ordered 5 days before me. hope you get it by wed next week. seems like vins are assigned to lrs now so hopefully.  od 19/11 | melbourne",0
289,ordered mine on the 29/11 (m3 lr red). still no vin ,0
