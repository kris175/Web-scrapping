0,"i think also  is a defacto waiting room, but the more general the merrier!  model 3 lr, black interior, midnight silver exterior order date: 08/11 vin / edd: n/a location: nsw",0
1,"yeah, definitely planning on doing that. i'm also spending way too much time on the tesla forums on whirlpool, and he mentioned to me there that until you have a vin there's no benefit.",0
2,i ordered on the same day with the same colors. the only difference mine is lr. i wonder who is going to get vin first,0
3,"i would expect to first see a hidden vin in the first weeks of january (use the  if you don't have it already) - once you have a car allocated presumably then the slightly more specific dates start appearing, and from what i hear shifting around all the time until much closer to delivery.   i'm sure the next few months will fly by, but man it would've been nice to have the new car over the summer break! whenever it comes there'll be plenty of time to enjoy it i guess.   but we're not on these forums to be patiently waiting, we're here to speculate and second guess and try to will our cars into coming sooner! ",0
4,"just the ""blank"" rego papers, or complete ones with vin etc? i got the former the day i ordered, but not sure what the benefit is for them having half complete rego papers? maybe they can fill in the rest once i have paid and i don't have to do it again.",0
5,"woo! i just got a call from my sa, there was a cancellation and i'm getting a car on the 29th. i could've had it this week (23-24th) but with family christmas stuff that was going to be too complicated so i sacrificed a few days.  (order date was 8/11 - m3 lr, msm/black interior)  edit: i have a delivery date and hidden vin in my account page now.. it's really happening! feels so weird to go from a generic blank page with no estimate to that in the span of an hour.",1
6,wohoo~ congrats mate.  hope few more cancellation pop up   curious to know have you had vin matched before the cancellation reallocation ?,0
7,"no, because i was literally doing my daily check of my account page (yeah, i'm a tragic) when the sa called - she asked if i wanted it this year, or to wait for a 2022 build - i did ask if there was any difference, seeing if she's say anything about the computer, but she just said it's already got the new battery pack going into the '22 models. of course i accepted her offer. she then negotiated the delivery appointment with me via sms after that, and said that she'll get the match sorted out once we'd settled on a date/time. took another 15-30 minutes or so before the delivery appt and hidden vin appeared in my account (i was refreshing every 5-10 min at that point..). no final invoice yet, will see when that comes through.",0
8,"hi all - 1st post  model 3 lr, black interior, midnight silver exterior order date: 16/12 vin / edd: n/a location: gold coast",0
9,"i ordered 10/10/21 and it was showing 1-3 weeks at that time, when i got a vin it changed to 2-6 weeks and it ended up actually being 5 weeks from order.",1
10,"i contacted the sales adviser in late nov and was told;   - january vin assignment  - hopefully february delivery  then first week in dec was told;  - early next year vin assignment  so i am not hopeful. i have waited for custom order audis before, and that was a 6 month plus wait so it is what it is. it’s not as if i would change to any other car anyway   fingers crossed they over deliver. it would be a very positive customer experience them hitting the 8-12 week estimate i was originally provided. so that is key[card]s in hand jan 11 to feb 8.",0
11,"any november orders seeing a hidden vin yet? mine still showing as null. 7 weeks from order date this weekend and my 8-12week estimate is getting closer, fingers crossed for a vin in the next couple of weeks! planning a holiday to airlie beach at easter, driving up from the gold coast. hopefully we will have our tesla by then. also fingers crossed we will see new superchargers at bundaberg (childers) - was estimated for q4 2021, and rockhampton - estimated q1 2022. anyone know if the childers supercharger has been built/ or is in the process of being built yet?",0
12,"you won't get a vin until the car is built (which will likely be early jan), and i wouldn't expect the car until early-mid feb at best.  childers appears to be one of the many q4 2021 pin misses. no-one has spotted a site under construction yet.",0
13,"i wonder what will happen when the ship morning clara departs china, i'm trying to piece together bits of broken up information from a bunch of places i've found over the last year, some have said that a vin will appear (false, as in matched to a vin) when the car is loaded/just after loading/ship has departed...  guess we'll have to tell, the ship is supposed to arrive in shanghai tomorrow (2nd), some posts seem to indicate that ship loading can happen in 24-48hrs and it departs again.  might be worth checking this again later in the week ",0
14,"don't expect to, the tesla purchase experience is similar to buying a phone from telstra. you'll next hear from them once they've assigned you a vin and the issue you an invoice for payment.",0
15,still no vin or ed on our 6/11 order for lr white/white in melbourne. just hoping to get it within the next month... probably optimistic.,0
16,"it’s january! start keeping an eye out for those hidden vins. while i love my car and it’s been fun driving around, and wouldn’t give up my early delivery, i kinda miss that i won’t have the full hidden vin / ship tracking experience. maybe the next car!",0
17,"i'm watching morning clara on vesselfinder and myshiptracking but the position data is 11 days old. i believe the ship is in shanghai right now about to sail to brisbane, port kembla (for sydney deliveries?) and then melbourne. is there a better way to track ships? if my car is on that ship, when can i expect a hidden vin to appear in the source code? i'm young and very inexperienced in car hunting / ship tracking (ok, not young, but still inexperienced).",0
18," i've seen some reports in 2021 that varies everywhere from hidden vin showed up when loaded to ship left, and others that say they saw nothing until it was basically here already..  considering i expect to take delivery of 3x perf models in q1 hopefully, we'll soon see if it's just random or not.",0
19,"i just received the mail from solar victoria regarding the application for zev subsidy, although there is no vin assigned yet on the account.",0
20,"it's visible for some, not others, and doesn't seem to follow any rhyme or reason. just know you will be contacted when the time comes. and you can do vin checks leading up to that, but don't sweat it if nothing appears for a few more weeks.",0
21,"founds some answers.... looks like all model 3's will get ryzen by around may, until then it's a lotto. you can check with the sales rep once you have a vin and cancel/delay if you like. i probably will to wait for the faster chip.    ",0
22,"when you get your vin assigned reach out to your sa to confirm. the sa won't have access to the system that contains your car's spec, but they have access to someone within tesla that can look up the car's details. this will be the only way to confirm, if last quarter is any guide there will be a lot of wild speculation on the internet that only cars with a vin after xxx or built from x date, most of it will be wrong.  through my sa in late october 2021 i was able to confirm that my car was coming with the 60kwh batttery, the other tesla contact ended up calling me back to confirm over the phone the battery.",0
23,"same here. phone app is now saying 14-20 weeks again. interestingly, when i go to my management page for my order i now have, under my order number, a field for vin which currently lists as n/a. and the edd is back here as well as 14-20 weeks. things are continually changing with regard to information displayed.   ",0
24,  did you install the chrome extension which give you all the information at the bottom of the page? when i installed that it gave me the vin n/a under my reference number too.,0
25,quite possible though there was no mention by  in his announcement that this was part of the extension. looking at his screen dumps you can see the vin field partially scrubbed out.  update: to confirm it is the extension my view of the same page in macos safari does not have the vin field so you are correct.,0
26,dont we need a vin to subscribe?,0
27," you don’t need a vin, but it will help later on. for those joining so far this so year, the focus has been on educating/coaching on what to look for. the focus for the group now is to study shanghai factory videos looking for right hand drive exports. this will then move on to vins, build dates, ships, and estimated delivery dates as the quarter progresses.  others in the group are good at analysing rumours vs facts - particularly on hardware changes.  my advice on whether to subscribe - is only do so now if you want to do a deep dive investigation on when cars in shnghai are being built. if you are just interested in the ships your car is likely on, wait for a vin and build date.",0
28,i have now signed up for the vedaprime service following my order on 16/11. i have to say that the patreon link to discord that he provides is seriously good. most of my questions have now been answered after a single day on discord and the information on shipping and deliveries and how the system works is first class. highly recommended. once my vin arrives i will follow through on the delivery identification service that is also provided.,0
29,"i received a phone call from my sa (to introduce himself) plus text messages plus email/s. this was during the hectic time pre-nsw incentives starting and heaps of vehicles arriving. so maybe i got lucky. but there was no contact until after there was a vin and the various ""online paperwork"" started. he seemed very busy and once or twice i had to do a polite reminder. there were a few issues with logins and stuff which he handled efficiently and effectively. overall, the total experience was excellent and equal to the best in 57yrs of buying cars.",1
30,"just spoke to my tesla rep and was told that they are planning for deliveries in feb 22. was also told that once my model 3 is in transit to oz and processed, i should have a vin assigned which will likely be closer to the end of this month. fingers crossed that we will get no delays!",1
31,my sa also advised that i will be receiving a delivery updates in the coming week or week after (say end of the month). hopefully we will all have a vin by then!,0
32,i was advised today that i should receive vin in the next couple of weeks. not that it sounded like an overly ‘educated’ statement. but here’s hoping! my trade-in’s km are slowly racking up close to the estimated figure i gave and don’t want a drop in value.,0
33,i also got called today from my sa advising late feb early march.  i ordered the rwd in early november in melbourne.  he had no idea about the odds of getting new processor. but whatever i just want the car now haha was told the vin and invoice would be sent in next 2 weeks or so...,0
34,vins will be issued after being built. cars will be built out to about early feb. only the first shipment will be getting their vin first because their car is built. no ships have departed shanghai.,0
35,once you have a vin your sa will be able to call their internal contact to confirm whether your car has the amd chip or not. happy for you to dm me if they tell you otherwise.,0
36,"order date 24/11. just to share some hopes...  just got a courtesy call from my sa. told me that i should expect a vin to be assigned in the next couple of weeks (by the end of jan) and confirmed that the car hasn't been built yet.  when i asked about the chip, he wasn't sure but he did mention that all new cars delivered in china now come with amd, just not sure about au yet since there haven't been any deliveries yet. they will be able to tell when the first car lands. he also indicated that the chips won't be random, as in some cars come with atom while others ryzen. it is decided by the built date. based on the chat, he seemed quite confident with the new chip.  but again, nothing is confirmed so far.",0
37,"so, i just checked with my sa, as i ordered after you 30/11 (if i remember correctly), and a performance, and delivery in sydney. my sa said, he still expects my delivery in 8-12 weeks, (no mention of from ordering date like website says or from now mind you), but i am reading this as delivery before end of march, though 12 weeks would be end of feb...  no amd chip knowledge either, he said they will only know once the cars arrive in country, though i do suspect that's not 100%, there should be a mechanism to match vin to parts, but that might be out of his ability. though i will be pushing him to check this once i get a vin assigned.",0
38," i ordered my m3lr 2 days on 14 nov 2021, 2 days after yours. i got a call a few days ago saying to expect a vin soon. i asked about the amd chip and they said they're not sure as it was being slowly rolled out between now and the end of q2.   once a vin is allocated to the order it should be possible to get a definitive answer about what the car has. seems to me the upgrades are worth cancelling the order and going to the back of the queue for. i only paid $150 for the order fee - which is now $350, however i noted the price of the m3lr has been reduced by $200 from when i ordered it.",0
39,"nobody knows for sure, but late feb/early march is likely. until you're assigned a vin number nobody can say for sure.   i ordered 13 december (rwd) and have been told by a sales agent that the cutoff was 20 december for this quarter's cars. however, that may not hold true for lr and performance models; there was another poster somewhere in this forum who's been told he may be delayed, and he ordered (i think?) a performance earlier than i did in december. the cutoff date may be a little different for each model. let's hope the factory didn't run out of some crucial parts just before building our cars.",0
40,"same, my sa never reached out. i had to send a few emails before tesla called me and told me who my sa was. i sent him a message last friday but no response yet. well it is what it is. just hoping we get a vin by the end of jan.",0
41,"i only had an rn number, infact i still only have the rn number on the page, i got the vin from the chrome extension.",1
42,like wise -- vin can be found in extension,0
43,just now checked my account and i've been assigned a vin starting with lrw ,1
44," correct.. look at source code for lrw  some other sites/forums said to review the source for isnotmatchedtora00vin"" bit.... but mine still says true and has been the whole time even though the vin is actually there today!

55,"no vin but have this now - ""estimated delivery: february 11 - february 25""",0
56,"interesting that the range change only affects lr. surely there's a logical reason for it not affecting rwd/sr+? advertised ranges sandbagged in advance?  also, no hidden vin for me yet (order details below)",0
57,with vin’s circulating today can anyone confirm that we are about to receive 2022 production models? believe the 10 th letter in the vin should be n…. thanks,0
58,my vin has tenth letter as n and build date is 10/01/2022,0
59,anybody received a vin on a silver lr? my sa told me i should make the cutoff but given tesla seems to build in batches if others with the same configuration have received vins and i haven’t my gut feel is i’d be q2,0

74,is anyone who ordered in nov and still haven't got vin yet?,0
75," veda and many others have explained it pretty clearly: orders are built then assigned - not the other way around, if you don't have a vin yet - your combo hasn't been built in sufficient quantities to assign you one.",0
76,"sucks, but it would seems likely that combo isn't being produced in the quantities needed for the current global demand and you've drawn the short straw.  i'm waiting on a white lr and my agent told me that while he had originally assumed i would get it this round, they weren't getting as many as expected and my order was one of the types that was delayed. i'm new to all this, but i have to assume that my combo is also relatively common being white/white lr.   the issue here is that to compare my order date to others would be ignoring things like global demand (this is the australian specific thread so you will be missing a massive amount of data) changes to orders (i changed spec on 20th, which no doubt pushed me back in queue), silent orders (eg those who don't join forums to post info online lol) i can see why veda said this metric isn't really helpful for determining delivery, it has far too many variables.  imho, best to just treat it as a preorder without a date until you get the vin (and join veda's tracking once you do - if you're into that)",0

79,"don't be dramatic,  tesla builds based on demand, and that is based on demand 2 quarters ago (confirmed from veda a few posts ago) and would be specific for your region (lhd vs rhd).  my point is that your order date has a lot of things riding on it and isn't going to be black and white. take mine for instance, which was ordered on 6/12/2021. i've changed from black to white interior on the 20th which would push me back in that sub-queue, and i don't know how this impacts my order in the queue either.  i guess you can compare to others if they share the same spec and around the same order date to get a guideline for yourself, but i would take any date with a pinch of salt until i have a vin personally.",0
80,m3 lr exterior white interior black od 19/11 no vin or notification yet,0
81, od 10/11 lr white/black i have vin and delivery date range listed,1
82,"this is normal with the vin allocation system. it is so amazing, logic does not work. order dates mean very little in this process as i say repeatedly at the beginning of every quarter. it just takes an example to prove it.  my message to people with no vins - hold out for another 3 weeks. if no vin by then reach out to your adviser. waiting for a tesla is an emotional rollercoaster, and there are more curves and ups and downs ahead. delays are ahead for shipping and transporters - as there are every quarter and the estimated delivery dates are untrustworthy and will move a lot.  it is an amazing system. this is why i look at all this closely over last 2 years.",0

96,"i heard that is manual allocation of vin and based on distance/time to deliver. as they want to make sure these are delivered in the q1 not held up in shipping. so perth have prob done earlier as they need to be off loaded, stuck on a truck and shipped again. this will mean that while i have a vin and a delivery date. if you are close to the landing point you will still get it before me.  if anyone that cannot stand the wait with for their long range performance i will swap your for my vin and delivery confirmed rwd  at no extra cost of course.",0

121,how did you figure out the production date from vin ?,0
122,"lr/rmc/black/aero no fsd, order date was 08/04/21.  got a call from tesla staff 12/21/21 that i needed to answer the ""how are you going to pay?"" question and apply for financing because my car was coming in the next week (no vin).  applied for financing same day, was approved. delivery window got down to 12/29/21 to 12/31/21, no vin ever assigned. car never came.  has been bumped out twice and is now 01/27/22 - 02/24/22. at 5 months wait already i'm relatively confident my reservation is bugged in some way. tesla staff have called me to tell me car was coming in the next week and it didn't. no vin has ever been assigned. people with identical configs who ordered months later are receiving their cars.  if only there was a phone number i could call to figure out what's going on...i'm 20 minutes from the fremont factory they don't even need to deliver it...i'll take an uber...  bonus: credit approval is only good for 30 days. i guess i'll take  hard credit check hit if they ever assign a vin.",0

128,surely the rest of us must be getting our vins this week! i’m hoping for another round of vin assignments in the next few days. fingers crossed!,0
129,"od: 14 nov 2021, lr blue, no extras.  just got off the phone with tesla sales. i speak with a different person every time as i don't seem to have an sa.   anyway she said edd is now march (not feb) and that all cars on the next shipment will be built in 2022 and have the ryzen chip.   seems consistent with other messages here.  the reason i haven't got the reduced range acceptance is the vin hasn't been assigned yet. apparently vin will be allocated in the next 2 weeks.  fingers crossed!",0

131,fyi this is a good url to get the vin without looking in the source if you have one.    change the rn to your rn and it should show it for you. it showed in there at same time the vin extension found it in the source.,0
132,did you already have a vin or did that happen today too?,0
133,had a hidden vin for about a week,0
134,would it be fair to say that if you do not have a vin yet your tesla is still in shanghai or to be built?,0
135,"i think the only ones with vin's are from november 2021, i have a vin but was lucky enough to get a cancellation. i think they allocated mine from one of the people who ordered in oct-nov, so wouldn't count that as an lr vin from december order.",0
136, my od 13/11. looks like the ones with vin for lr ordered before 12/11.  i agree with the person posted earlier. it's all over the place...,0
137,"i ordered rwd early december, no vin yet for me",0
138,"from my experience so far and i have a long-range with the order finalised on 2 december. i did order earlier but changed the colour.  i have my vin, estimated delivery date, and already paid the invoice. i received the invoice about the time ship left shanghai for australia.  now i have a paid service where i can track ships. but what i suggest you do is keep an eye on the port of shanghai and in particular the picture i have posted. i believe it is here where the teslas are loaded. but you will not know the destination of the ships until they leave port. that should give you a fair indication of the location of your vehicle.  currently, there is a ship heading toward australia from this location. i could be wrong, but i would think that most who have vehicles on the ship would have their vin number and either received an invoice or it is coming very soon.  i wish tesla themselves were more forthcoming on information so as to avoid so much uncertainty among those waiting for vehicles.

139,it's a quiet week for vin assignments .. so far,0

141,ordered 19/11 and still no vin ,0
142,"i ordered an lr red model 3 with a white interior back in nov. within 4 weeks it was ready for payment. sadly my bank was dragging its heels. i asked tesla for an extra 2 days (on top of the week they allow for payment), but they said no. the car was given to someone else, and sure enough, 2 days later i had the cash.   i've since ordered the same model on 1/12 (8-12 week wait quoted at the time). no vin or updates from tesla yet.  i guess on the bright side, now it'll be a 2022 build and hopefully have the ryzen chip. tbh that is a better outcome than getting it a few months earlier.",0
143,why would that not be allocated to somebody waiting for a vin for a similar car? is it old stock with old computer?,0
144,"i don't think they are old tech. what happens is - when someone cancels the order after the vin allocation, the car goes to existing inventory until sa allocate that car to the queue. if you are smart enough to grab it in that narrow window, that car is yours.",0
145,it's heartbreaking waking up each day waiting for the vin and then not receiving it. i only want it so i know the car exists.,0
146,i ordered an msm lr white on 16/11/2021 melbourne delivery. no vin yet. no nothing. not worried as my workmate ordered a tesla last year. same happened to him. he got vin and invoice on same day and delivery 2 days later while all at the same time people were getting vin's and invoices on all sorts of dates. shows there is no logic to the system at all.,0
147,"13/11, lr  yes, no vin  if there is manual allocation of the vin how do they know at tesla they don’t miss orders to allocate to?",0
148,"i sent an email to tesla today via their ‘leasingpartner’ address, enquiring about the timeline to receive a vin and then an actual car i wasn’t expecting a quick response but this afternoon someone called and said i’d get a vin later this week and a late-february or early-march delivery m3lr, white/black, ordered 26.11.21",0
149,"it’s a mixed bag of order dates with vins, as expected, from lots of different dates including late december.  it all depends on what has been built or planned to be built in the quarter, confirming order dates mean very little for vin assignment.",0
150,"hi dan  i initially ordered my lr mid-november but changed the color in the first week of december. this apparently changes the order date. i do have the vin and invoice. it is like vedaprime says, some things obviously don't make sense but the next ship from china will only be a week or two behind the first.  also, you may still get your vin any day. has tesla given you an estimated delivery window? this should also give you some indication of whether you're on the first or second ship.  i think, and this is my opinion only, that if you have an estimated two-week delivery window from early february you are most likely on the first ship but if your window goes into march probably more likely on the ship following.",0
151," hi,  no, there is no delivery timeframe in my tesla account. we'll wait. i've seen that some lr got vin at the beginning of the previous week and nothing since then...",0
152,i'm curious if any of lr's people are going to get vin by the end of this week.,0
153,do you get notification via email or text message? or this is something we need to check in account portal?  i have received vin on 17/01 but no invoice has been issued so far.,0
154," yep, i ordered when it showed 8-12 weeks and now 10 weeks later there is still no vin  they started production at the beginning of jan and i can't imagine they have not built enough the most popular lr spec. looks like they've got shitty allocation procedures",0
155,any p's been issued a vin yet? i ordered on 5/12 (p w/b) and was saying 8-12 wks but that reference has vanished the past wk. not quite sure why?,0
156,"yes, i ordered on 5/12, and got the vin assigned on 24/1. base specs white ext/black int, 18"" wheels, etc , melbourne",0
157,in the beginning it was noobie questions prior to finding this forum. then there was a bit of back and forth around inclusions in the 22 model builds like the new ryzen cpu etc. it has all been via text and one phone call. i messaged him this morning to see if he still thought vin assignment would happen this month as i was curious with chinese new year coming up and that country basically goes into shutdown during that time.,0
158,"my sa just called me to say that there had been a bit of a delay at the factory with white interiors. car will still be delivered in march, but i would not see the vin until the 5-7 of feb. i’ve got a white lr with white interior ordered. order date was 19/11.   regards, stephen",0
159,vedaprime did mention vin allocation normally takes a few weeks anyway so it's probably not abnormal that you do not have one yet.,0

217,"i think my rep was mistaken about the 'big one'. he originally said the two ships which were on their way had a much smaller number of tesla's on them compared to 'the big one' which was coming. to my knowledge though it's only the midas and crystal which are coming for this quarter.  since i had that discussion with the rep i have received a vin and paid my invoice. my edd is now showing as next week or the week after. so i'm guessing my car is on the crystal.  i've reached out to the rep to find out exactly which ship my car is on and will post when i find out.  the cutoff for the q1 aus cars was apparently around the 20th of dec.  order: model 3 lr, red, white interior date: 1/12/21 edd: 13-27th feb vin: yes location: canberra",0

221,i ordered on the 30 nov and don't have a vin yet. my understanding from what vedaprime has said is that this isn't really a problem yet. my edd is still 8-12 weeks from order date.,0

225,"i wonder about this too. if vins are assigned randomly and there are more orders than cars, isn’t it possible that any order at any time may go unfilled? for example we know of people in november waiting for a vin while someone in january has one.  extremely bizarre system. i’d be pretty upset if that happened to me.",0

235,welcome to the rabbit hole  did you just get your vin today?,0
236,"from what i can see the midas leaves pk just after midnight which means that cars should start to be processed from tomorrow. i suspect that everyone with a car allocated from the midas has a vin and invoice. so for those without these, this ship has sailed!  the crystal is due in pk on the 13th feb, but for some reason is not leaving brisbane until the 12th... there could be some delay? this timetable fits those who have a confirmed delivery at the end of feb and the beginning of march. it would seem that the vin and invoices if the same process as the midas should already have been allocated. however, let's say things got out of control in china (which i doubt) the allocations you would think would need to be completed by the end of this week.  the problem is as vedaprime has said many times that demand has outstripped supply. too many orders, not enough cars. waitlists all over the world are 3 months or more. tesla is running 1 quarter behind on orders.  i don't know if vedaprime has identified another shipment in march? without giving too much away he/she may at least confirm or deny",0

303, it will be very interesting to see what happens.  i’ve been closely watching everything and been expecting a vin for weeks now and every time i get my hopes up it just doesn’t happen.   i don’t really mind either way would just like the certainty.  in saying that i really enjoy seeing everyone else go through the process of getting theirs.,

307,"its impossible to tell, especially this early. the cut off for q1 as an example was 20/12/2021 (where it changed from 8-12 to 12-16 or something like this) however there has been cases of ppl ordering in early jan that now has vin assigned as well as customers ordering in early nov. that dont have a vin yet. lrs and ps seem to attract longer wait times however odd configs, aka blue (yes blue seems to be less frequently selected colour) attract shorter wait times. these are my general observations that have played out over the course of my q1 wait.",
308,i was exact config as yours... order updated to rwd yesterday (14/02) .. vin in source this morning (517) no edd yet,
309,"order date will appear on your order agreement pdf in your account. edd will appear on your account too or on the app. the edd will jump around and/or disappear. from what i've gathered don't be too alarmed if a generic edd like 8-12 weeks, 5-7 months never appears or changes, it doesn't mean much  for example, my account never showed an edd until i got a vin and a more solid date range. so until then i wouldn't worry about what the edd on your account says",
310,"yeh the vin/edd process will continue, took around 5 weeks to get edd & got my vin today, i ordered m3 rwd 21/12/21 & did the finance option, no trade-in. hope that helps.",
311,"based on this number, there will be a total of 4000 m3's offloaded in pk in q1 via 3 ships (midas/crystal/clara), assume 1000 for nz, which leaves roughly 3000 for au q1 deliveries. comparing with 12,000 total m3 delivered here last year, looks like au m3 allocation from shanghai giga remains unchanged in 2022, but m3 demand could have been doubled/tripled as indicated by the 5-7 months waiting time. this monday, the total pending orders without vin might have exceed 3000 (q2's total allocation), which had triggered the edd updated on the web site.",
312,the best bet may be to join vedaprime for $15 and get an exact answer. once you have your vin and build date vedprime will be able to tell you and then you would need to arrange with your tesla rep. the other problem you may have is registration.,
313,"that is risky if you just want to come across and pickup in quick turnaround time. as far as i can gather your pickup window is narrow and can change so you could be either stuck in sydney for some extra days or not be ready to pickup if they move you up the queue. also if you have a vin already allocated the system would likely have the load and unload position already set. back in the day when i worked for customs the dock unloads for vehicles was not as choreographed as i believe they are now, but we hated changes in paperwork for inspections etc. worth talking to your sa to see if it is viable as i am just speculating.  you beat me to it - registration is the obvious biggie!",
314,"it's highly likely your order will be delayed to q2 since you haven't been assigned a vin and a delivery window by now, like many of the lr and p orders. production cycle in q2 will mean earliest delivery will likely be mid-may, similar to mid-feb deliveries we are seeing now for q1 built cars from shanghai.",
315,where do you usually see the vin ?,
316,"that sounds like an ad  not sure why every time someone in this tread mentions sharing of information about logistics of delivery, it's brushed off with ""oh that's what vedaprime is for, don't bother and go buy subscription"". yep, information that is provided there could be superior, but hey, we are on a free forum sharing free information, why that could not be a good alternative to paid service? raised in geek culture of 90s i still believe in open source etc and hate paying for information. osint ftw   just to make my contribution to discussion - that's my understanding, feel free to correct, just don't do ""that's wrong, go subscribe to vedaprime to get the right info""   1) after you make an order paying $350 deposit, you get in one of the queues. queues are probably grouped by car configuration. if you order now (mid feb), there is a chance you would get delivery in q2, but as estimated timeline was bumped up to 5-7 months this week, those chances are slipping away. order date usually correlates with delivery date, but there are exceptions when some car configurations take much more time to deliver than others. consensus is that more popular configurations like ""rwd white/black"" have shorter wait time. 2) vin is assigned to you several days after your car is built. cars for au are built in batches, this year we saw 2 batches in jan and 1 batch in feb (looks like that is a change comparing to last year, when cars were built once a quarter). you cannot track anything before vin is assigned. vin could be easily checked in  (under ""tesla 3.."" header) or source code of your reservation page if you look for ""lrw"". 3)  - vin decoder that works for 2022 cars 4) after you get a vin, you can expect final invoice appear under ""documents"" section of your reservation page in couple of days. if that does not occur, contact your sa. final invoice provide one more piece of information - build date. 5) people with ed dates in feb (and build dates in 2nd week of jan) had their cars on morning midas and morning crystal. both are already unloaded in port kembla, some people got their cars delivered already, some would get delivery next week or two. 6) people with ed dates in march (and build dates in 2nd week of feb) have their cars on morning clara ship that left shanghai yesterday, expecting in brisbane on 26-28 of feb, and in port kembla on 1-4 march. cars for vic, nsw and sa would be unloaded here, and moved by trailers to final destinations. as i understand, that takes additional 3-7 days. not sure about other states. 7) cars for au are loaded in shanghai port (not luchao) at this terminal  you can track which ships are moored in several apps/sites - marinetraffic, fleetmon etc. basically, all of those apps have free accounts that provide you limited information, but combination of that could be useful. best chance to guess which ship will head to au is to check last visited ports of the ship - vesselfinder.net provides that information. when ship is not covered by terrestrial ais (i.e. is in open sea), those services prefer not to show position for free, but looks like shipfix () shows you pretty recent position (if not, try to open in incognito browser window). marinetraffic app allows you to set up a few notifications for free when ship is leaving/arriving/changing destination etc. when eta of the ship is 5-10 days, it should appear on arrival page of port authorities: brisbane:  - go to ""ship movements"", press ""query"", select needed dates and ""max"" port kembla:  8) you would get sms with 3 proposed dates to pick up the car week in advance. you would need to have your payment cleared prior to pick up. you can pay by transferring the money to citibank account. account details are mentioned on your reservation page, do not use any other details sent in emails/sms - that could be scam. account number should be the same as your reservation number. do not forget to add reference ""rnxxx..."" to your transfer. yes, you can do multiple partial transfers. transfers would appear on your reservation page in breakdown of the costs 0-2 business days after payment. 9) (i haven't got to this stage, so could be lots of errors here) when accepting delivery, you would be asked to sign documents first - sounds dodgy, but looks like common practice. to do thorough check, download tesla delivery checklist app.",
317,step 2: you can also run this api endpoint after logging in with tesla to get your vin - i assume it populates each of the boxes that represent your cars(or pending orders)  if its there the request should look like this; ,
318,"i never thought id sub to the veda service but decided to due to 0 sa communication worth it? yeah it has been for me personally, am i going to track my car myself? no, can i outsource that and get personalised tracking, yes  if you want to simplify it down think about next time you do online shopping and have to pay extra for tracking, thats essentially what you are doing ill pay the $30 over two months, it'll be the cheapest ""accessory"" i get for the car but thats me personally  i think veda themselves has advised that if all you care about is tracking your vehicle then it wouldn't be worth it till you have a vin (can't track what doesn't exist)  that said its prob best to redirect this thread back towards its intended purpose rather then what now looks like a veda commercial   to that end, i emailed my sa last week pushing for a final invoice so i could prepare my funds etc they called me like 5 days later while i was busy at work so missed the call, then emailed saying i wouldn't get my invoice till 10 days before delivery.... i'd received my invoice hours after sending my email so your sa mileage may vary",
319,"i don't believe that in the slightest. unfortunately there are currently not many new people but as the new quarter comes around then i am sure this thread will return to normal.  as for fighting over veda's service. if someone wants to spend money to subscribe to marinetraffic and then spend the time to work it all out for themselves then good for them. i have no idea how much marinetraffic charges for its subscription but it must be cheap.  people subscribe to vedaprime because it has the answers without digging through pages and pages of information. the other information and community there also is a bonus.  it is each to their own and now that we have had the discussion we should go back to the waiting game and be frustrated that we don't yet have a vin rather than someone offering a service that you don't need to be a part of. if that person is so frustrated by the service and the answer being ""go check out vedaprime"" they should start a free thread on tmc here which has all the information and accuracy without the subscription price.",

321,"hi all,  long time reader (3+ years) first time poster.   i’ve been lucky enough to own a model 3 performance for a little over a year and recently took delivery of a rwd model 3. my brother also took delivery of one of a shanghai built model 3 performance mid-2021 and we couldn’t be happier with the vehicles so i just want to say, to all of those that are waiting, rest assured the wait is worth it.   this will be a long-ish post and will likely be lost amongst but hopefully it’s useful for at least one person that finds this post, and is patient enough to read it.   i will break it down into a few steps for people and try to strike a balance between being informative and concise.     compared to ordering a car from a dealer i found the process of ordering from tesla very simple.  i popped into my local tesla store and had a look. my sales associate was new and admitted that at the time. i had no issue with this, as there were a few technical questions i threw at her that she wasn’t sure of. compared to the audi dealership i went into, the service at tesla was a lot more friendly and (in my opinion) genuine, and the advisor apologise side not knowing answers and called a more experienced advisor who assisted with some of the technical questions but didn’t try to poach the sale or put the advisor down, it was much more of a team effort.   the audi guy was a cookie cutter sales guy, and when i asked questions he either gave out information that was outright wrong, and when i told him i was cross-shopping a tesla he took any opportunity to smear ‘the competition’.   while i couldn’t negotiate with tesla, the deals offered by audi were constantly shifting goalposts as i asked about different trade in and finance options. it was extremely hard to get a straight answer from them and just felt mucky, complicated and like no matter what i did i was always leaving something on the table.   i still test drive both the audi and the audi, but after some time behind the wheel with the model 3 and the s5 sportback i decided the tesla was just a much better driving experience.     if you’re reading this you’ve probably already taken the plunge, pulled the trigger, bitten the bullet, insert metaphor here.   as mentioned above, i’ve now ordered and taken delivery of two model 3s so this is based on both my experience as well as my interpretation of 120+ pages of other customers experiences and insights into the process. there are certainly some assumptions and there will always be exceptions to ‘the rules’ but this is just a bit of what i think people should expect and what to try to avoid getting stressed about.   after placing an order, you will likely hear from your sales associate with some congratulations and guide on what to expect next and what you need to do in order to complete your order. once you’ve provided the necessary details and uploads in your account there’s not much else you need to do, unless you’re financing.     if you are financing through tesla, it may take a while to hear from your chosen provider. they seem to reach out to customers as vehicles get closer to being deliverable which makes sense, as applications are only valid for a certain number of days, however they will typically reach out with plenty of time to get everything sorted in time for delivery.   in the meantime it can’t hurt to get a copy of your home lease agreement or mortgage statement as well as keeping your most recent 3 months worth of payslips ready to send off when they ask for them.   whether your paying cash outright, or paying a deposit with finance you should wait until your final invoice is issued from tesla before making any payment. here’s a bit of a summary guide      while i can see

322,"hi all,  long time reader (3+ years) first time poster.   i’ve been lucky enough to own a model 3 performance for a little over a year and recently took delivery of a rwd model 3. my brother also took delivery of one of a shanghai built model 3 performance mid-2021 and we couldn’t be happier with the vehicles so i just want to say, to all of those that are waiting, rest assured the wait is worth it.   this will be a long-ish post and will likely be lost amongst but hopefully it’s useful for at least one person that finds this post, and is patient enough to read it.   i will break it down into a few steps for people and try to strike a balance between being informative and concise.     compared to ordering a car from a dealer i found the process of ordering from tesla very simple.  i popped into my local tesla store and had a look. my sales associate was new and admitted that at the time. i had no issue with this, as there were a few technical questions i threw at her that she wasn’t sure of. compared to the audi dealership i went into, the service at tesla was a lot more friendly and (in my opinion) genuine, and the advisor apologise side not knowing answers and called a more experienced advisor who assisted with some of the technical questions but didn’t try to poach the sale or put the advisor down, it was much more of a team effort.   the audi guy was a cookie cutter sales guy, and when i asked questions he either gave out information that was outright wrong, and when i told him i was cross-shopping a tesla he took any opportunity to smear ‘the competition’.   while i couldn’t negotiate with tesla, the deals offered by audi were constantly shifting goalposts as i asked about different trade in and finance options. it was extremely hard to get a straight answer from them and just felt mucky, complicated and like no matter what i did i was always leaving something on the table.   i still test drive both the audi and the audi, but after some time behind the wheel with the model 3 and the s5 sportback i decided the tesla was just a much better driving experience.     if you’re reading this you’ve probably already taken the plunge, pulled the trigger, bitten the bullet, insert metaphor here.   as mentioned above, i’ve now ordered and taken delivery of two model 3s so this is based on both my experience as well as my interpretation of 120+ pages of other customers experiences and insights into the process. there are certainly some assumptions and there will always be exceptions to ‘the rules’ but this is just a bit of what i think people should expect and what to try to avoid getting stressed about.   after placing an order, you will likely hear from your sales associate with some congratulations and guide on what to expect next and what you need to do in order to complete your order. once you’ve provided the necessary details and uploads in your account there’s not much else you need to do, unless you’re financing.     if you are financing through tesla, it may take a while to hear from your chosen provider. they seem to reach out to customers as vehicles get closer to being deliverable which makes sense, as applications are only valid for a certain number of days, however they will typically reach out with plenty of time to get everything sorted in time for delivery.   in the meantime it can’t hurt to get a copy of your home lease agreement or mortgage statement as well as keeping your most recent 3 months worth of payslips ready to send off when they ask for them.   whether your paying cash outright, or paying a deposit with finance you should wait until your final invoice is issued from tesla before making any payment. here’s a bit of a summary guide      while i can see that a lot of people want to know their vin asap and know what ship their car is on this information is mostly useless unless you’re just super curious.   from what i can tell from my experience, as well as the thousands of comments made by others in this thread there’s a pretty simple formula to follow that could save everyone a little stress.    overall, i’ve found that the best approach to

323,"hi all,  i got my vin on the 10/2 (517 range) and in my tesla account it’s got the balance owing and bank account details etc but no final invoice under documents. any idea how long i should wait before chasing up the final invoice? edd is 12-26 march? regards, stephen",
324,that’s really disappointing. i ordered the same spec and colour in canberra five days earlier and supposedly have a vin and edd of 10-25 march. i won’t feel relic until i actually see and invoice though…,
325,"i believe it was, but don't remember exactly. sa said at time of order to expect to wait 3 months - mid feb to early mar delivery so i'd been going mostly off that until i got vin assigned and a date range in the app.  the date range was initially something like 26/02-11/03 after vin was assigned, but was later revised to 18/02-05/03. sorry i can't be more helpful with the the original estimate.",

327,"not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but when i access the link to view the vin , it's changed.  a couple of weeks ago that link took me to what appears to be the owners page, with a space where the vin would go (it was blank) along with my documents listed (no invoice obviously) and some messages about using the app.  now when i click the same link i just get taken to a generic dashboard page - .  this happened to anyone else?  maybe they got sick of me hitting f5 every 10 minutes.",
328,"first ordered white on 26/12/21, changed to msm on 06/01/22 dictated by my fashion police (daughter). got est. delivery of 09/03 -> 22/03 in early feb. got vin and final invoice last week. think i am pretty lucky with a wait time of around 8-10 weeks.",
329,"i had the same after a vin was assigned to me, you can check your vin in source code. hit ctrl + u then ctrl + f, enter lrw and you might find it.",
330, i can’t use the api call to see if i have a vin yet. so something must have changed,
331,"my vin checker has been updated on github. you will need a raspberry pi 3 or newer to make it work, but it is a super easy install. feedback appreciated as it is a work in progress and i may expand it to other platforms in the future.  ",
332,"i had an interesting discussion with my sa this morning. so i've got my vin on 9/2 (od 9/12/21), and when checking up the possible delivery date he said, ""i'll wake the car up and check where it is"" and it is still in shanghai, delivery around the end of march  this would suggest there is more boats coming this quarter.  fyi tesla sales have been very helpful to me, i changed out of novated leasing without trouble, or without loosing my vin. they have been quite easy to get in contact with.",
333,i think it's time i took a seat in here too. so far i have nothing showing up in the app or any secret vin in the code but all fingers are tightly crossed for something soon.  m3 rwd od: 15/1/22 white/black adelaide,

335,they are on the morning clara expected to dock in port kembla around 2nd of march at my estimation. if you have your vin and final invoice the sms to book in will be soon after.,
336,i got the vin and edd about 12 days ago for 9th-23rd of march in sydney. but i haven't even received the invoice yet.,
337,"same here. got my vin on the 10/2, edd between the 12th-26th march but still no invoice. they say it can take a couple of weeks.  regards, stephen",
338,"my edd is 9/3 - 23/3, but still no final invoice, will my rwd (od 18/12) be on morning clara? i do have vin since 10/2",
339,"which means all orders with vin will be on morning clare, next ship will be late april or early may, i guess i am the lucky few who order before the quarter cutoff date in dec",
340,"have you tried reaching out to your sa? i got the final invoice after notifying mine about the vin and delivery date being updated. had a bit of a laff about ""not refreshing the page every 20 seconds"" ",
341,"anyone in regional area/sa/tas got vin before delivery? can't find vin in account neither edd, i asked my sales adviser, he told me good chance have my rwd delivery end of march. ordered 31/12/2021",
342," being a regional area you will not get an edd  you will get a vin though, hidden to start, followed within days to a few weeks later by an invoice  have you checked for a hidden vin? look at your car order details page, then in edge or chrome (ctrl-u) to open source code on the page then (ctrl-f) and search for lrw",
343,i received an email from tesla this morning asking me to pay the balance before delivery. the message also appears on my tesla account page along with tesla bank details.  i was under the impression that i would receive a downloadable invoice which would include my vin and production date. so far my vin is only available through the chrome extension. i’ve had no contact from any sa. edd is still showing from march 10-24.  should i expect a proper invoice in coming days?,
344,"just noticed in the emails with the invoicing team, this little nugget in the sig block. so they really do just give your vin to someone else and its even policy  """,
345,"hi all, so i received by vin on the 10/2 and i can see the final payment balance in my account (edd 12-26th march), but i still have not received my final invoice. i'll chase my sa again tomorrow when he is back at work (chatswood), but getting a little frustrated. is getting the final invoice pdf a ""show stopper"" for booking a delivery time?  regards, stephen",
346,does this still work? i was reading vedaprimes website yesterday and step 2 says   “   a vin number is no longer hidden in the source code.     ,

352,long time listener first time caller..  ordered 6/12  midnight silver rwd 19” black interior for delivery in adelaide.   had some fun and games with pepper finance where they lost my application but finally sorted. no vin but got a text on thursday that a car had been allocated.   spoke with my sa on friday he said expect a vin next week. so assuming mine is sitting on the morning clara. very excited for my first ev!,
353,i assume you are regularly doing the vin search using the browser extension or searching the source manually?,
354,hey all! curious how some of you know how your model 3 is on the morning clara? i ordered a rwd christmas eve and got confirmation delivery between march10-24 and i have a vin assigned.  i'm curious if i'm on the the morning clara too,
355,"is it possible for someone to be allocated a car at the “last minute” - ie, no vin yet, and edd is 14-20 weeks (ordered on 15/1), but they decide to allocate you a car from a shipment that has come in? just wondering whether to keep some hope alive of a march delivery ",
356,just got off the phone with my sa. vin arrived first thing this morning and my edd is last week of march in adelaide.,
357,"09/03 (obviously not gonna happen today) -> 23/03 (most likely) i was kind of lucky, first ordered 26/12/21 but changed colour from white to msm on 06/01/22 and told by sa that it was considered as a new order. got vin and est. dates in mid feb. sa said that they must have made lots of msm rwd in shanghai, not sure how true that is.",
358,"unless you got your vin and invoice by 7-10th of feb, your car is not on morning clara",
359,final invoice happens sometime after getting a vin assigned to you. vin assignment would probably happen about a month or two out from when the car ships.  there's some posts explaining how to get your vin(around page 100 i think) kalamata posted a bit of a guide and there's others who have left comments about how to also get your vin from the website.  once i found my vin i contacted the sales assistant(sa) and they put through my final invoice shortly after that.,
360,"haha! it's fine, i'm already adjusted to the idea of getting it in may. i have a nice new house to move into in april anyway, so there's enough excitement to keep me going. but the comments from those folks are helpful because i had no idea whether i was meant to receive the vin before or after it goes on the ship.",
361,"those without an assigned vin will start getting allocated vins around 15th april which is around when the next ship will leave shanghai. based on the last two quarters the first batch of q2 au cars will be built around 8-10th april.   these are my guesses based on what's happened in the past, if you want a more accurate, real-time tracking service consider signing up for vedaprime's service.",
362,awesome... it's like waiting for a vin all over again,
363,"i now have an invoice, a vin and yet another estimate of delivery date: 16-25.3.22 at alexandria leasing person is chasing up a firmer date - see how that goes",
364,"my own last purchase before this with mercades there was massive delays and wait. salespeople really new nothing but kept giving me estimates till they got a vin. then i tracked myself as i could back then. i always did the follow up.  my most recent purchase for my wife was a toyota dealer in 2020. rav4 hybrid. nothing but delays and lies till we had enough and escalated up the chain till we finally got some answers.  this time round ordering tesla, rep didn’t really know too much, but never lied. once i got my hands on my vin went with veda prime service and couldn’t have been happier. the community is way more active on tesla for some reason but really you will get nothing till you vin is allocated.",
365,"delays in manufacturing are across the board at the moment. if it's got a computer in it - there's almost certainly a delay.  i work for a medical device company and we have major delays on our capital equipment. pretty much anyone buying any high value item wants it now and doesn't want to wait; but there is nothing that can be done. we want to supply our customers as fast as possible - just as i assume telsa does too.  unfortunately there is a huge delay and the only real info that can be provided before you have a vin is what's on the order screen. your sa won't have some guy in the factory who he can talk to about when the cars will come - it'll still be...the lead time on the website.   i'm actually impressed that tesla has a lead time that updates on their website. most car manufacturers don't have that and it would be highly unlikely that they would bother updating it. i've seen it move twice since i ordered making me think it's perfectly integrated into their crm system. best in class service, in my opinion, for the new car industry.  and yes. - i too am impatient and want my car now.",
366,", my sa rang to deliver the bad news. quite a few others got the same call from their sa... basically those who ordered in q4 2021 and still not assigned a vin are unfortunately looking at q2 production. the reason given was tesla significantly underestimated the number of au orders for lr and p models and didn't have sufficient production in q1 2022, hence pushing it into q2.",
367,"yes, i have received my vin number on 14th feb 2022. the build & compliance date for the tesla model 3 rwd is 08th feb 2022. my initial edd was 12 - 26 march but was updated by tesla to 18-31 march 2022. hope i receive the text message about the exact delivery date soon.",

370,"well, just about time for me to depart this waiting room as my delivery is scheduled for first thing next week. since joining this forum early jan after placing my order mid december. i've found that i'm not the only impatient bastard out there . was nice to find a bunch of like minded people going through what i was going through. it has been a great little community and to all the new guys/gals that have joined, you'll find some comfort in here. another huge shoutout to  for the service he/she provides. if you want to dig deeper than what you find on here, highly recommend joining the discord. i only joined for a month and was able to soak up enough knowledge that i didn't feel the need to renew. if you do the same, ensure you follow the rules     - the tesla order waiting period is a roller coaster - take what your sa says with a grain of salt (if you even get assigned one). some seem to be better than others so i recommend cross referencing information on here - the edd you are given in the app can & will change/dissapear multiple times - order date has to do with vin allocation date  i wish you all the best of luck and hope to give you the tesla wave on the roads in bris in the future. dal333 out.",
371,"hi all,  i ordered my m3 on 18/2 (a month ago) and i haven't received my vin yet is that normal?  my tesla portal says the following:  ",

373,"that's normal. i ordered mine in december and received my vin in feb. not sure what your edd is, but i think you'll be in for a bit of a wait for your vin.",
374," so it's been 4 months and it hasn't been built yet?  i have only paid the $350 deposit, and completed all the registration paperwork... is there anything i could be missing to explain the delay? it seems like most people ordering at around the same time as me got vin numbers within a month",
375,"currently, australian-delivered cars are built over a couple of days in the first month of each quarter. if your car has been bumped to a may delivery, that means it's in the q2 builds in april.  (the vin isn't assigned immediately after building, though - some get assigned when they're already on the boat).",
376,"it'll be the same as all the others made in april.  tesla don't really have ""model years"" but the vin will reflect the build date.",
377,  i’ll see if i can help you out a little here.  the long range and performance models had very few built in jan and feb.  unfortunately for both you and me that means we missed out and will have to wait and see what april brings for builds.  cars will get allocated a vin anywhere from straight out of the factory to on the ship heading to aus.   there were a lot of lr and p orders that got bumped to q2 and that’s what the phone call stating may delivery was for.  next builds will be early-mid april so fingers crossed you are first in line for one of those.,
378,"that’s unlucky i ordered at almost the same time and my car is here - also m3lr i never saw a vin or an invoice until last week, but that might be because i’m leasing? the extra hands involved in processing this have caused delays in paperwork and delivery but i’ll have the car next week",
379,"hi guys, we're taking delivery of a lr at work this week and i can confirm cancelled orders are passed onto the next customer. we got this from tesla today:  please note that due to the high volume of tesla orders, cleared funds are required and the vehicle delivered within 1 week of arrival at our delivery centre. if delivery is not possible within the required 1 week, the vin will be unmatched and matched to the next available customer ready for delivery. your order will then be re-matched from our next arrivals",
380,"thankyou for this thread, i have learnt so much about what to expect during the waiting and then delivery phase. ordered a lr 1st of feb so hopefully, i'm about halfway through. was getting anxious that i hadn't seen a vin yet, but the info in here put my worries at ease. (but i still check the app everyday just in case something happens!) good luck to all.",
381,i order the same day with you and no vin number neither.   the only information i can see : est delivery: 14-20weeks.,
382,"ordered a rwd on 17th of jan, still no vin yet",
383,"to note, the same is not true in queensland — no plates are fitted until it hits the state. you can still take out insurance with a vin though.",
384,i ordered 06 feb but as i'm getting a truck delivery to nq my edd has disappeared. hopefully vin finder in chrome will pick up something soon - fingers crossed i see something in april.,
385,my build was 9/2 for a 9/12 order but that was still an 8-12 week delivery timeframe. so based on this (rough) logic you might still have a way to go before your car is built. if it doesn't get built around the 9/4 i'd assume you'd be in the next qtr window (so 9/7) they can't allocate you a vin until they've built the car.  don't stress about the edd disappearing its common with third party deliveries.  the glorious day when vin finder changes from no vin found to you have been assigned a vin will come soon enough!,
386, i am fnq as well. our edd will never appear as we get the vehicle freighted to us. chrome vin finder will still work though and mid april is when the next lot of vins will likely come out.,
387,i'll be getting tinting & considering ceramic coating when my m3 arrives  can anyone recommend a shop in adelaide for this. m3rwd blue/black od 21/2/22 vin tba edd ?????,
388,gathering my m3r multi-white/black/18's won't be on that one then given i don't have a vin yet   ordered 22/01/22 (14-20w range),
389,i'm desperately trying to hold myself back from buying until i get a vin number. once that drops then the shopping starts!!,
390,so...it's april. does this mean some of you are filled with hope of being assigned a vin in the next week or two? fingers crossed for you all!,
391,"i am one of those. i have resigned myself to being pushed to next quarter though to be honest based on factory closures and the rest of it - my guess is that once aus production is completed, those who are getting pushed will be contacted. hopefully i'm wrong and a vin appears mid-month!",
392,"we'll know in around two weeks whether the rep is right (how can they know how long the factory will remain shut down?) if this thread starts to light up with ""i got my vin assigned"" messages.",
393,"new member - lr blue/black ordered 26/11/2021, originally 8 -12 weeks. currently no vin and no edd, hoping for the next shipment.  sorry for the long first post, i culled it down as much as i could, is there a better forum to continue this discussion? even when you get used to this, what about when you lend your car to a commodore driving relative/friend!  my initial reaction to your experience was ""you will get used to it like all us other european car owners"". but on reflection i think this is a very serious safety issue. my wife and i haven't had a right hand blinker car for 20 years (but the kids have). my wife has a mercedes b class with the silly shift stalk on the right. i don't drive my wife's car very much but every now and then i have a brain fade and have used the right stalk for blinkers. however, the difference in the merc is that it gives you neutral, not reverse. it is annoying but i guess not really dangerous. i don't have my tesla yet to try it out but it seems it is worse in the tesla since it will shift to reverse even if you are going forward at up to 8kph ( do you have to have your foot on the brake to do that, the manual doesn't really say). so in a car park i can easily envisage how you could end up in reverse and it might not just be a car behind you that you hit, pedestrians often walk behind you as you slowly move forward.  anyway, i have 2 suggestions, one a mitigation and the other a possible solution (undoubtedly there are other solutions).  1/. my bmw has a hidden setting you can change with the bimmercode app that makes it beep in the cabin when you are in reverse, apparently this is a requirement in japan (and apparently very annoying) so i assume tesla would already have the function for japanese cars. so they could make this an optional setting and then at least you would be aware that you did it.  2/. they could make the action to select reverse to be foot on brake, push stalk up and then a momentary press of the left scroll button on the steering wheel. might be a tad annoying but i think i could get used to it and better than an injured or dead pedestrian.  both these suggestions would be a smop (small matter of programming) and of course they can just push it out over the air.  americans won't understand this problem at all, but hertz are now renting the model 3 and y in the usa, so they will be getting tourists from right hand drive countries who are already a bit stressed from coping with driving on the other side of the road etc, so i think it is a problem for the usa too (and all the other left hand drive countries).   does anyone know how to communicate to elon musk?",
394,vins can be allocated anywhere between the factory and reaching pk on the ship. you won't 100% get a vin before the car is shipped. to make matters worse the shanghai factory is still in shutdown and it is one day at a time as to when it will reopen.,
395,same order as me. i'm in melbourne and ordered about 10 days after you. let me know when you get a vin as hopefully they would build mine straight after yours!,
396,  oh this sucks so bad. was really hoping to get the vin this month but apparently the world has other plans.,
397,"i had a question about the 'next steps before delivery'. the salesman i spoke to when ordering in the store said that i would receive a final invoice before delivery. do i need to pay anything more than the $350 initial deposit to progress my order, get a vin, and then be sent the final invoice?  i can't see anything in the order agreement about a 5-10% deposit or anything, that some other car manufactures require. it's been 5 months and  a lot of other people on here that ordered around the same as me seem to at least have a vin assigned, if not picked up their car. so just want to make sure i haven't been skipped because i missed a step in the process. my account says the next steps are submit final payment, but i can't see a final invoice, only the order agreement. do i need to send the payment from the order agreement to get assigned a car and progress to the delivery step?    *edit: i don't know how to do the signature thing that everyone else has, so here are my order details: brisbane - model 3 lr | order date: 15/11/2021 | vin: n/a | delivery: n/a",
398,"nope, that's all you need to do. the vin won't appear until sometime after the cars are manufactured for the quarter - this would have been about now, but for the shanghai lockdown.",
399,"somethings going on with the source code of my order page. last night i had 109 references to ""vin"" in the source code (including words like 'driving', 'evincentive' and 'saving'). i now have 86. no vin hiding in there still though. this means basically nothing but anything, however miniscule, sets me off at the moment. like that time a referrertoken variable happened to include ""lrw""... condolences (and big ups) to the tesla web designer working on a public holiday. unless they are working a normal monday in shanghai... in which case way more big ups i suppose.  estimated delivery (14-20 weeks) still the same.",
400,i ordeerd mine 4 dec no vin as yet im in tas,
401,you probably ordered a rwd then? if so then what you're experiencing is probably a genuine stuff up as many dec and even jan rwd orders were successfully delivered.  all of the orders in dec still waiting for a vin are lr/ps.,
402,"11 for me! has anyone got a vin in the last few days/weeks? assuming a 6 week shipping time from vin (as stated by sa), my 14-20 window is fast running out. i think 2 weeks left. though i am guessing vin assignments and shipping schedules are far from stable or static at the moment so who knows.",
403,ordered 17/01/2022 - brisbane. still no vin ,
404,"once people get vins, this thread will be full of people popping in   6 weeks sounds right and it what it took in q1. there were the floods in qld which affected delivery dates. hopefully once a vin is assigned it's 6 weeks or less!  you would hope they just spend 3 or 4 days to fulfill all the outstanding aus/nz orders and ship them over!",
405,"how late it is will depend on when you ordered and how many they can crank out. i'm guessing if (if) they stick to their early month aus run they'll be made in a couple of weeks and we'll get them 6 weeks after that. that's right at the end of my window and one week late for you. super late for the 2021 crew.   which will be confirmed if we get a pre-build vin assignment. reading various forums, tesla used to send a text about 10 days prior to production. i am guessing most get their vin then (given what my sa said about vin coming 6 weeks before delivery) and a few get them post build due to order cancellations or whathaveyou. but who the hell knows if the production schedule even resembles the pre-lockdown schedule. for all we know they made them this week.   unless they had some left from previous production or made some this week and chucked them on morning clara or don juan. it's not a normal situation and the shipping or production isn't normal either. the ships might be all switched up and out of whack given the situation. if tesla couldn't ship to capacity on clara or crystal, they wouldn't just send the ships out empty or have them sit there. they'd assign another ship to tesla later (as we can see in the shifting shipping schedule) and ship what they could.   also my mother called me this arvo and said she saw a truck full of brand new, regoless teslas. so who the hell knows what's going on there...  i also wish there was less constant news and tesla focus on model y and at least a single article about model 3.",
406,agreed. i am staying firmly in the optimist camp. also suspect shipping won't resemble pre-lockdown at all. nor will production. and potentially nor will vin allocation. so who knows. they might even chuck a few on don juan. probably not... but we can hope!,
407,interesting. i’ve been waiting until i get a vin to order financing (if i need it). will be a nice surprise if i’m not pushed back a quarter.,
408,just spoke to my sa. he’s very confident there is a large batch of vin allocations very imminent. implied mine would be in that. should def be here this q. ordered 27/1 rwd blue/black sydney.,
409,"hey guys! i am from sydney and initially ordered my model 3 lr white/white on 05/02/22, however i made some exterior colour changes but i finalised it by 16/02/22 and my delivery date still says 14-20 weeks on my account.  what's the go with shanghai and vin allocation and/or approx. delivery date?  any info will be helpful to me! thanks ",
410,"yeah once a vin is allocated you can probably get a consignment number or the vin itself is a shipping reference or something and track it much like a parcel. manifests would also be lodged with customs or the ports. i think that's what vedaprime teaches you to do for money. that's assuming the vin allocation is done prior to shipping. but given we're currently in bizarro world, who knows what's happening with vin allocation.   that said, i doubt there are any on the ship.",
411,"mine usually holds a login for over a day but this morning keeps booting me out. probably more likely to be some type of an update to the website generally or an outage somewhere because globally they would be allocating vins in the system pretty consistently you would think (i.e. we're currently not getting vin allocations because somewhere else in the world, they are).",

418,no-one has a vin at the moment. nobody really knows until it's confirmed what cars get loaded onto ships in the next fortnight.,
419, i think i was notified of a vin before 1 week before it was on a boat that left shanghai...  feb 9 - vin feb 15 - morning clara left shanghai feb 28 - invoice,
420,do they officially notify you of the vin or are we just relying on finding it ourselves in the source code?,
421, they will notify you of the vin usually via sms.  the source code just gives us early access to it.,
422,i got my sms a day after a vin was assigned.  ,
423,"hi all. is there a table anywhere where australians can enter their order date, location, model trim, vin date, delivery date? that would help us all gauge expected delivery times.",
424,great idea. i can setup a google excel spreadsheet for this and share it for everyone to add their details? what headings do we need?  drivetrain - rwd/lr/p colour - white/black/grey/blue/red wheels - 18/19/20 interior - black/white fsd - y/n finance - tesla partner/own finance/cash order date vin allocated delivery date,
425,"so i just called the perth tesla centre for an update on my eta (ordered 6 feb, 16-20 week edd) and the guy i spoke to said we're on track for a june delivery and that the vin should be coming through shortly. sounds like bollocks to me given it would have to be on ship that's left already to make it to perth for a june delivery (the two june ships get to perth on 28 june, so no way they would give you a june delivery).",
426,"thanks mark071. no vin yet, apparently.",
427,"great! thank you. everyone please go and add your order to the list, so we can gauge delivery dates. those who have received a vin or car would be especially helpful.",
428,no vin ,

430,"still in the cjk anchorage. but it's eta in shanghai is the 7th. if it goes to luchao, it's on.   i have been sleuthing the vin assignment process. from what i gather, once loaded, a reconciliation is done of cars produced against orders and that's when we see vins going out. i am hoping this aligns with the ""batch of vins issued very soon"" reports we are hearing from sas and live chat.",

436,"not sure we've ever known exactly what the process really is. the vin is created before before the car is built, but when that vin is assigned to the buyer is unknown. and processes change. with the supply chain issues it wouldn't surprise me if they were building whatever they have the parts to build and then telling australian head office what they are getting as its loaded onto the ship. if the shanghai lockdown caused them not to receive the battery packs from the gigafactory in nevada (i think that's still where the cells for lr & p are made) we could see nothing but rwds roll off the boat when it arrives. not saying that's what's happened but in these unusual times processes change to accommodate a changing world.",

462,"upon the import declaration being submitted to the australian integrated cargo system (i.e. abf/customs). the transaction value is calculated on the rate of exchange on the day of export. how that plays into the tesla ordering process likely varies and i am unsure. for me, i have already had an invoice issued against a purchase order which states the transaction value but the car has not been imported or submitted to the ics (as far as i am aware). this submission would probably happen on the ship once they 100% know what they're actually exporting? thinking about it, this is probably when a vin is assigned because they would have to enter a transaction value (therefore tangible good) against your specific transaction.",

473,"i didn't expect them to know which ship, i don't think it is unreasonable to ask them to find out. someone in australia is booking trucks to pick up specific vins from specific ports on specific dates. i suspect production schedules might be ""commercial in confidence"", but it would be nice if when they assign a vin to your order they also told you the ship it is on. i guess it wouldn't matter if they had a reliable and predictable process. perhaps it will be better in the future when they don't have covid lockdowns etc.  the problem is that i have to move some money around to complete the payment (done half of it already) and also take my current car to the dealer i am selling it to. all that takes time, so if they told me right now i could get it tomorrow, it will probably be at least 2-3 days more before i can get the money there. i don't want to sell my car now and then be without a car for 1 or 2 weeks. if they confirmed my car was on turandot, for example, i would sell my car tomorrow and then move the money to citibank and i would probably be ready by about next tuesday, and the car would probably be ready for delivery a day or two after that. i sure hope the car is as good as i remember it was last november!!!!",

500,"if you're waiting for a car, the only thing that is a true indicator of an impending delivery is an assigned vin. knock yourself out trying looking at the source code, the only signal that will confirm that your car has been built and is on the way from shanghai is an assigned vin. based on past experience, this place is likely to light up with people confirming they've got vins assigned around 15th july.  don't think of it as a queue but rather a delivery cohort. tesla don't have a method whereby an order pulls a build through the system (which would allow you to know now when your car is scheduled to be built in the future), but rather build in batches for markets. those in aug-nov are hoping for vin assigned in mid july for a mid august delivery, otherwise there will  be a second ship in q3 to deliver cars by end of september. without a vin, nobody can confirm a thing.",
501,anyone had a vin assigned? how many of you follow the ,
502,when are you guys starting to buy accessories? once vin is allocated?,
503,surely you jest. i ordered my m3p in feb and by april all the accessories i planned to buy had arrived. i'll likely get my vin in august.,
504,"gen3 charger(installed), modell 3 car key, jack point pucks , led puddle lights, no vin yet.......",
505,"nope. next thing that happens is a vin assigned, but that doesn't happen until a car is built and matched to your order. on current estimated delivery dates, that's probably not going to be until late january.",
506,"thats about right money for ppf. i got everything ready to go from accessories to the wall charger still waiting on vin allocation , ill be doing full ppf and ceramic tint on the car myself. fingers crossed vin will be allocated soon.",
507,"to add this, the au cars have recently been built between the 8th-10th of the first month of the quarter (hence why we missed the april slot). knock yourself out looking for a ship departing from the 12th onwards, the only real confirmation will be once this forum will light up around 15th onwards with people posting that they've had a vin assigned.",
508,just pay for the car when you receive the invoice - which will have a vin on it - and it will be all yours.,
509,"yeah, i'm a little worried about that too - never know when a 4 day factory shutdown will change the shape of the footwells or the centre console or the screen size / shape, etc. trying to delay further accessory purchases until i have a vin - but some of those accessories look so cool!  and to get something with telsa model 3 in the name/description arrive quickly and on or before the delivery date the website says!

510,"i've heard of them being used before but have wondered if it really makes a difference.  was trying to imagine our cx5 without the engine noise and hearing tires and wind noise etc.  i guess the quieter the car becomes the more obvious those noises become.   have bookmarked this page, similar to the floor matts, am trying to wait until vin comes before more purchases in case there are slight changes to the m3 that would need a different accessory.",

515, i ordered 3lr in blue early dec 21 and no sign of a vin as yet. i live in cbr,
516,"a couple of objective points of data: i guess on your logic you could say all 81 orders with vin allocated ""no"" have abandoned the spreadsheet. and you're right, the data is by no means guaranteed to be updated.  i guess my point is - sure people in the uk are getting their orders now, but who's to say that some in the uk aren't waiting as long as some in au have been waiting?  and if we're going to start thinking about complaining to tesla management, surely we should be more objective about the situation than ""some people in (the bigger market that is) the uk have got their orders now, why haven't we?""",
517,"the data you have just outlined says that.  we all have aug - oct or aug - nov in here if we ordered anywhere from november to february/march.  the bulk of the orders on the spreadsheet without vin allocations you outlined are march onwards. anyone from march onwards in here has either 6-9 (not sure if there any of those left) or 9-12 months.  aside from a couple of outliers, very few prior to march feature at all, indicating they likely aren't an issue/have been delivered.  i'm pretty sure ""people in (the bigger market that is) the uk have got their orders now, why haven't we?"" is in fact an entirely valid question.  how's the attached for objective? honestly. i get that people pride themselves on being stoic and what they believe to be mature. but if you're cool with this, you're stoic to the point of being a doormat.",
518,either ship would fit the timeline that my sa gave me for being notified i've been allocated a vin  but then again.... all signs point to them having no idea hahaha,
519,"whilst being in new zealand, about 3 days ago, i had a change in the source code: ""isnotmatchedtora00vin"":false.  previously this was ""true"". wondering if this indicates that my m3 is scheduled for production?  no vin yet but something has changed.......",
520,from everything i've seen on all the other forums... it means you're close to being assigned a vin. before last year it would appear that the change in this variable would be followed by a vin really quickly... the source code changed the isnotmatched variable for me about 1-2 weeks ago though and i still don't have a vin. my sa told me to expect it next month.,
521,vin can also be found via source code (account --> f12 --> sources) perform a search and search for 5yj. the variables should have your vin assigned.  ,

532,"not sure about everyone else who has an order in dec/jan (ie is ""overdue""), but seems to me that getting a vin will do a lot to instantly fix the mental damage caused to date by the waiting. me: no vin yet (mid-jan order lr)",
533,ahh. this is what i expected. after many many months of struggling without a car and grabbing my wife’s when it was free i finally cracked on the weekend and bought an interim 2nd hand car. my assumption was that this would provoke murphy into doing something and it would appear this is the case.  gotta love murphy.  let’s see if he’s got plans for my vin too.,
534,to all the people who are getting the vin's allocated is the vin starting with lrw or 5yj. also which part of the source code does the vin no. appear? if you dont have it in your signature it would be great if you could put the order date and combination with your post it will really help us people still waiting for the vin. thanks,
535,"good to see something happening, it was getting a bit weird in here. no vin for me yet, ordered 14/2.  maybe just clearing all the dec/jan back orders before shutdown but fingers crossed",

538,"white with white lr, ordered 4th jan 22. still no vin for me, fingers crossed it is still on it's way!",
539,i ordered late march.. white/black rwd. still showing 6-9 months and not the month range haha  definitely not expecting a vin anytime soon,
540,got a vin for the car i ordered on 03/12/21. still waiting on the final invoice.,

544,"whether you get a vin in the next weeks or not its great to see movement. when you see no movement its easy to think we have been forgotten and look to other queues and see movement there then call unfair.  no idea how they are picking the orders to send vins out for, but i certainly wish luck to all in the queue, especially those who have been waiting the longest.  edit: okay looks like lrs are coming in from 2/12 - 4/12 so far, rwds from 13/1 - 16/1. no info on ps yet",
545,"i hope my vin turns up soon. i'm starting to worry that keys l, r and w will stop working on my keyboard....",
546,"thought i might give this place a rest for a few days……… talk about a roller coaster of a ride catching up on 10 pages of posting. glad to hear some cars are coming our way. as someone said, with each vin allocated we all move that little closer to the front of the cue.  as one unknown wise person once said. “i had my patience tested. it’s negative.” bring on my vin!",
547,"no vin yet, but have progressed to the next step in the order process, had to accept the tesla vision change etc.",
548,"once you have accepted that, you should be able to find your vin in the source code",
549,omg i have a vin for my 3!!!  i ordered my rwd white/black on 15/1 in sydney.,
550,"anyone know how long it is from moment your car is built to your vin appearing in source code?  do we think there will be vin allocations every day?? i'm buzzing, i have to know  someone get that darth veda guy back in here",
551,"the vin finder plug in and a manual source code search both negative, i'll try again later.",
552,vin appears first then your car is built usually take up to two weeks from vin appearing to delivery but with all the delays who knows when the delivery will take place after vin is allocated.,
553,ah right... i thought vin was only assigned once you had been assigned a built car...,
554,"so what’s everyone’s theory with this? seems an unusual time in the quarter for vin allocation? surely something to do with the impending shutdown. build dates will start to tell the story of course. have they had a late quarter run for us in leu of an early quarter run that will now be missed? is this an extra run they managed to squeeze in so they can clear some of our backlog? be interesting to know if these are yet to be built, just built today or maybe already on ship on their way here?",
555,you'd like to think they are working through the orders chronologicallly for each build spec so i'm guessing that everyone with an od before jan 17 or whatever the latest vin receiving od on the chart is would have been assigned one?,
556,someone with an order on 17.2.22 received vin allocation . just read it in a reply to vedaprime on tweeter,
557,"hey, feb 19 melbourne order checking in here. when you get your vin could you be a good chap and decline it so i can have it instead? that'd be great  lol  nice choice! see you on the road ",
558,"no sure im in feb and havent received anything, funny enough my sa just returned my phone call and he told me vin allocation will start in the first 2 weeks of july and will include up to march orders according him, so all q2 orders, and they are expecting thousands of deliveries in q3 to a point they requesting saturday deliveries from q3. thats what he said.",
559,"based on the spreadsheet, i'd expect to hear vin allocation from: rwd -  (17/1) lr -  (26/11), @breezy_tesla (1/12), hopefully soon  (8/1) p - anyone?!    ",
560,"yes, rwd - aug to nov and lr - aug to oct  no vin yet.",
561,"nothing yet, ordered on 12/02; hoping to see a vin in next couple of weeks....hopefully....maybe...",
562,20/12/21 m3lr white/black. patiently waiting for vin to be allocated...,
563,have any performance models had a vin allocation?,
564,i was going to say i'm also patiently waiting but checking for a vin on my order page over 10 times a day ... not sure if that word is the right one for me ,
565,"i’m a bit disappointed that hoopy hasn’t got a vin yet. he was pretty good when i first joined, but as time went on he became more disillusioned with the process. i hope he gets a vin in this batch",
566,"yeah. currently due to dock at pt kembla, after a visit to bne. could be source of vehicles subject to vin allocations.",
567,"dumb question - i am yet to fill out the ""registration"" section in the task as i need to sort out a few things first for the driver's license. would this delay my vin allocation or delivery?",
568,got my vin and payment request - my sr white interior ordered at 10:30 on launch day! wooohoo!!,
569,i would ask your sales advisor. when did you place the order? if recently i wouldn't be too concerned as you're likely a way off getting a vin. if you placed nov/dec/jan i think it could impact things if a vin allocation is close for you.,
570,thank you! i’m sure you’ll get your vin allocations very soon along with everyone’s who waiting! ,
571,"no vin here, 12/1 red/black... for a moment, i had hopes... oh well... patience is a virtue... though the missus thinks this whole endeavour is a red herring and nothing is ever going to show up... be nice when i can prove her wrong and take her for a spin.. ",
572,"when i got my vin on 25/05, morning clara was parked off fraser island. it then stopped at brisbane, then went to port kembla, and unloaded the cars there.  given the current location of the ship now, there’s a reasonable chance they are on it.",
573,question for those with vins.  did you find the vin in the source code or was the first notice point when you had to accept tesla vision on the account page...or did you get a text?,
574,well didn't see this coming... got vin today for my sr ordered 10:30 am on day one. yet my lr m3 ordered 4/1/22 nothing....yet....,
575,"thank you for reaching out to support, my sa has ghosted me like a bad tinder date so its reassuring to hear this and gives me hope that i will get my vin with a february order",
576,"no m3 vins reported so far today.  i've decided not to track my vins as (1) this is the m3 waiting room and (2) my purchasers haven't been waiting in the order queue for long, so it can be heart breaking for m3 purchasers to see someone who ordered a my a week ago or so already getting a vin when they have been waiting in some cases 7 months or more.  but to those my people out there with vins, all the more power to you! just keep it down in the m3 room ",
577,"yep you should have a vin now, and you need to click the blue button.",
578,"yup, click the blue button and a vin should be on its way. a car in the not too distant future after that.",
579, i’m thinking this is correct. from what i’ve read the m3 and my production lines run simultaneously so it makes sense to me this is a vin allocation hold up rather then a production problem. i’ll be interested to see what happens next week assuming the reported my production line shuts down for the upgrade.,
580,"got the vin from google extension, thanks guys",
581,"firstly accepted tesla vision and reduced range within my account page. then found vin in source code.   still no official invoice, just a payment overview now in my main login page.   no text message.",
582,yes this does indicate you’re getting a vin. along with the update you received in your tesla account. the tesla app asking for bluetooth permissions if often the first sign of a vin from reading reddit waiting room/ deliveries in america.,
583,1. saw the vedaprime alert on this channel that vins would commence 2. opened the smart phone app and saw the vision and range acceptance request. looked but no vin in app. looked for final invoice - none. 3. looked for source code on pc and found it,
584,"multiple people have reported from different sources that the vins will be coming out over a number of weeks.   as a december lr you're in a good place to get notified fairly soon. currently the latest lr that we heard from that got a vin on this forum is  with 4th december. my guess is  will be be one of the next lr ones with an order date of 8th december. there are a number of others that have mentioned being december dates but they arent on the tracking spreadsheet ()  yes irritating that its taken so long but you're right at the front of the queue and if you look behind you its a long long queue! new orders are currently looking at feb 2023 - may 2023 delivery! chin up, you're almost there",
585,"hi guys, ordered my tesla model y 10/06/2022 10:40am wa time, got my vin number now. model 3 ordered 17/01/2022 still no vin",
586," hopefully we can see model 3 vin allocations tomorrow. if that is the case, i am predicting that for long range, they might try clear out either all of december or all of december and half of january for tomorrow.",
587," the model y (spreadsheet) mostly from whirlpool has quickly hit 150, but only probably 10-20 from this forum, so possibly the same number of tm3s actually produced.  more interesting question is what these vins mean? recently aus vins have only been allocated once cars were on ships, whereas in the us it can signal production.  given tesla's history of wanting to minimise cars in inventory i think it's unlikely any are actually on the water.  possibly china production for aus/uk began on say 28 june (when china delivery by 30 june is no longer possible) and they've just done a better job with vin allocation. some cars may be completed before the 1 july power shutdown and rushed to the early ship. others will remain partially completed and wait for reopening.",
588,at this rate you're probably closer to a vin than i am ,
589,"for vin allocation it looks like it's purely od within your range, right? i think delivery date will be the only thing that varies based on location?",
590,"since the vin allocation started on 28/6 and continued on 29/6 as well, i did realise that both vin allocations were made at around 12:30-1pm sydney time.   i think i am confident that we might be seeing more allocations today around that time as well. fingers crossed!",
591,"morning all. we are m3lr white/black melbs od 1/12 - can those who have received vins tell me how they received them? email? our account is now showing 'pay now' button, but thought we would receive a vin before that...also, could someone provide a link to the spreadsheet - can't seem to find it. many thanks.",
592,"my understanding is you have go through the app and/or web page and accept the new terms (range change, visual auto pilot) and then a vin is assigned possible hidden on the webpage.   if that is all done then you have the vin and should mean the car already exists (maybe?!) and will be on its way in good time.",
593,looks like they have had the vin allocation process happen (if its pay invoice stage). they are definitely within the date rate we have seen for lr already (28/11 -> 4/12),
594,anyway trolls dealt with. i am seeing a second day of no progress on the spreadsheet. do we think these are a couple of cars in a ship? doesn't fit building unless they are saving vin allocations to the 4 days the plant is shut down. or those initial ones were a test of the splash page.,
595,"meant to also say, you have the vin so that car is already matched and assigned to you. have never heard of a vin being unmatched. time to crack open a beer and celebrate i reckon!",
596,not sure about the notification part (i'm still waiting too). but i think before the vin appears in source code you need to have accepted the range and radar changes via app/account. maybe someone who has received a vin this week can confirm or correct this.,
597,"there seems to be a few signs:  1) you'll have a new screen on your profile page asking to confirm the change to vision from radar, and if you have lr a few km shorter range 2) you can check the source code, or use the chrome extension to check for vin 3) your app will ask for bluetooth permissions 4) you'll maybe get an invoice for the car 5) you'll get a pay button",
598,found my vin with the chrome extension today. jan 17 order.,
599,could be to prevent overload on all fronts... imagine how slammed their sa's would be if every order got their vin assigned on the same day haha ,
600," i imagine you'd be one of the very next to receive a vin for rwd, any news??",
601,"yeah ok makes sense. i guess a spot on the magical ship needs to be allocated, trucks need to be booked, customs paperwork done etc for each vin coming through. maybe that's the batch split even. though it does seem chronological at this point.",
602,did not check yesterday. i am on a novated lease. i had a pay update on my account after accepting tesla vision change. contacted my lease guys who checked with tesla and they said a vin may have been allocated with aug/sep delivery. that was yesterday.   checked today to see and it was there.   and thanks for the wishes. did you get yours?,
603,"is it true if your source code contains ""isnotmatchedtora00vin"":false then you have a build the vin isn't allocated just yet?",
604,someone in new zealand ordered on the 21st of feb a day after my order and got vin on the 28 of june. that looks promising,
605,no vin yet. i'm hoping they get on to february soon so i can stop checking the source code every five minutes.,
606,i’ve done a $1 test payment and it appeared as a credit to my account the follow day. i still don’t have an actual final invoice but you can commence to pre pay the balance anyway   still no official vin on my login page. just in the source code.,
607,"my experience has been that it happens in spurts over weeks. the cars are usually built over a couple days (we'll be able to confirm the build dates once people start getting their invoices) so build run has likely already been done before the shutdown. the positive is that they did a build run out of the usual sequence for au before the shutdown.  for the vin assignment i can easily imagine that it's one person that needs to log into a system to do it manually amongst their many other jobs, and that they've got a few weeks to get through it because the cars are still in shanghai or just have left and on the water.",
608,you would have thought a technology company like tesla should have automated vin assignment but it doesn't look like it by the rate how vin are assigned,
609,"it’s almost worse having *some* hope for an imminent delivery with this latest vin batch - until a few days ago i had totally checked out and resigned to getting my car some time before christmas. still reckon my (feb order) chances for a q3 delivery are low/moderate. not based in fact necessarily, just trying to manage my own expectations! good to hear the many voices of reason on this forum.",
610,"will post the updated vin list now.  i do note that while we didnt hear any new m3 vins or my vins today for australia (as i suspect that breezy and thegreenguy kicked off the process on the 28th), there was a note on twitter today that nz vins had started.  ",

612,"od 18/1 rwd blue/black brisbane no official vin yet, vin does appear in source code.  feeling like the wait is almost over.",
613,i first noticed changes in the app on tuesday. “tesla is making changes that impact your order….” but only confirmed source code vin today.,
614,"no vin and no change to my edd yet. really hoping for august, so i don't lose the lower interest rate.",
615,"out of interest, what is the trigger to lose the interest rate? date of delivery? date of payment?  its possible to pay almost immediately after the vin is available (hidden vin) it seems. are you able to push forward with the 'sale' at this point ?",
616,today i find myself wondering where the vin releasers are located. are they in the powered down factory offices in shanghai (july 1-4) or somewhere else?  thoughts? ,
617,in which case you would need the vin by the cut off date (august) which hopefully gets you a bit more time. so a whole 6-8 weeks or so yet. hopefully well before that though.,
618,"automated process   i mean they build the car to the queue orders, not some random set of blues, blacks, whites, long grey name with the correct interiors, tires, motors, etc.  so the vin is likely automatically stamped based on order # 1234 or whatever which they have just built. they do seem to batch the lr / rwd / ps a little though??  as to where the data centre is? not sure on tesla strategy - cloud? on-prem? but they are usually very careful about bringing down dcs.",
619,est delivery: 9-19 august chatswood delivery rwd white/white od: 13/01/2022 vin : 28/06/2022,
620," we need to see a dec, jan and feb lr vin allocation asap!",
621,has anyone in perth or regional wa received a vin yet? or is it just eastern states at this time?,
622,"i feel so bad for you, draco. i was driving the kids to school the other morning, all car windows and mirrors fogged up (so yep, couldn't see a thing), and saw a poor guy zooming down the road on an e-scooter. i remember commenting that it must be really awful to be on a scooter or motorbike right now, soooooo cold lately in perth!  fingers crossed you (and everyone else) gets that vin soon ",
623,"i love how we all sit here trying to decipher tesla's systems like vin allocation, hitting refresh over and over, when we all know deep down that it's tesla so there's no system at all.",

627,"but who are they producing for? au/nz/uk/sg (and others?) are essentially the same car. rhd, ccs2 port. they could be pumping out 2000 cars a day, but if 80% are heading to the uk who also got stiffed (10000 cars short in q2 is an estimate i've seen) by the q2 shutdown that could be why we think we are only seeing a couple hundred at a time for nz/au delivery. add in the batching of production runs and the vin assignment process and we really are just guessing how many are coming.",
628,"vins assigned cannot possibly equal more than 200 cars. we know how far along the queue they have gotten by way of order dates.   we don't have the number of orders but we do have verified orders on each day on the spreadsheet acting as triggers. had they done more, later orders would have vins. they do not however.   for rwd: 3 days of jan orders, for lr: 1 day of dec orders. for p: no evidence of anything.   if vin assignment was in the 1000s, orders would be 40,000+ to march.   i blame tesla. tesla is to blame.",
629,"everything we’ve heard from tesla suggests there are far more vin allocations and deliveries to come this quarter. this has come from multiple sources. so at this stage i believe it to be the case. the question is when will all this happen? from our end there doesn’t seem to be any logical plan to make it happen, but no doubt there is something we are not privy to going on. not having any idea how it will play out at the moment is pretty torturous.",
630,"i am flipping between optimism and skepticism. i dunno. i just would have expected more vins. and when edds firmed up today, it seems like the process moved onto the next stage. the full stop of the vin assignment, if you will.",
631,"even if you got the vin today you'd still be waiting another 6 weeks or so.  ah well, we will see what the next few weeks bring. and if wu wa's videos continue at the same cadence, then tomorrow (ish) there will be another video dated 1/6/2022 and we can have a look around the plant during shutdown. hopefully see a car park full of m3 rhds in assorted colours (but mainly white because au).  either way, back to waiting and making stuff up based on less than 1% evidence  except the tesla bad at comms. that part is 100% evidence.",
632,do we know how the vins are allocated in the past? does the vin allocation staggered over weeks or over few days?,
633,"hey all, here's a theory about what the *#*# is happening. no one else seems to have any idea. i have absolutely no evidence for any of this so you can discount and criticize all you like.  i think that tesla is very aware of the effects that their m3 delivery issues have had in au nz and uk and that they monitor forums like this one. before last tuesday there were a whole heap of predictions of doom from the july shutdowns, that there was no time for deliveries to au in q3, that the eu/uk were always prioritised over au, and hoopies were going all loopy everywhere. so, while not changing their production schedule at all, they gave us a day or so of vins to show us that both m3 and my orders would be delivered in q3, and gave them during the period the orders were being built. but this is not the usual way of tesla. issuing vins during manufacture would be a risky process, what with testing failures and transport accidents, so they then revert back to the usual and safer way of issuing vins, ie after the ship has left.   if this is the case, then expect no vins until after morning clara has left shanghai, say after 12 july. in tesla's usual fashion, possibly thousands of vins would then be gradually issued possibly over about a month for viking passama and morning crystal until after paglia leaves shanghai on 10 aug  due to the shutdown, m3s can now only be built between 5 and 17 july, so mclara would be mostly m3 and some my, vp m3 only, and mcrystal my only. the au/nz m3 numbers, say 6,000 will need 7 or 8 days production at 5,500/week, still leaving some time for other rhd markets.  i'm an optimist and will be looking for my m3 vin in mid july.",
634,"no offence intended, and you have missed the point entirely. they have been on rhd since 28 june or before. they only had to organise a short vin run, nothing else, and a few vins are much easier and more persuasive than a group email that tesla has never sent - even for the q2 cancellation.",
635,i think these are possibly your rhds at 1:48. paperwork on the left dash (see 2nd photo). about as many as the vin allocation.  at 2:50 you can see a driver on the car carrier get out of the left hand side (also attached - 3rd photo) and the paperwork is on the right dash.,
636,"hi marigold!  that spreadsheet is just those who have vins in this batch, which i'm managing as its still (unfortunately) small. if you have a vin just let me know and i'll put you on there with as much details are you're willing to share.  the other one people talk about is a multi country one and its largely self managed. there is a link to a form to add or edit your details on the list. link:  i can see you on the 2nd sheet for 14th december order. so just edit it via the form when you have more info to share ",
637,i think i am sticking to my guns here.   100ish 3s with vins allocated.   heaps of ys which they have now stopped making for 2 weeks.   just need that rhd 3 production to pick back up on mon/tues + have them australia bound. meet those 2 conditions and we're set. a vin spurt next week will confirm.,
638,"thanks  - found the international spreadsheet and added to it yesterday. will let you and the rest of the forum know when my vin arrives - recent activity suggests it may happen soon.   next question - can't find any options to insert a sig file, any pointers?",
639,awesome - now just have to resist until i at least have my vin ,
640,in m3 we talking about days from vin but in my it would be minutes from the vin.,
641,sounds a lot like the vin process.,
642,"it's not official, tesla doesn't publish such a list. if you have a rn # then i'm sure you're fine. hope you receive a vin soon.",
643,"data, process and behaviour analysis is what i do   this is all good practise for when i get my vin.  speaking of which, the above should be based on build date rather than vin date but until the invoices some in (i suspect it may have build date in there??) and we can get some actual build dates we can (temporarily) substitute with vin date (not accurate but meh, close enough for tmc speculation)",
644,"it gets complicated when you try to calculate for all of australia, because a lot of it comes down to ""it depends"" (e.g. perth cars sometimes get transferred onto a different ship in different ports). however to keep it simple, lets stick to mel-syd-bne.  ship arrives in port kembla, it then typically takes around 1-3 days for the cars to be processed. then it depends on how quickly they can book the car carriers (when your car gets booked on a carrier to leave the port this triggers the sms to book your delivery slot as they know when it's expected to arrive at the tesla delivery centre), typically the cars start arriving in tesla delivery centres around 4-20 days after processing. i've been in the position of having people posting photos of them and their new car on here and still waiting for the sms as my car is at the back of the queue to leave port kembla. i hope this is helpful. for those that have a vin and want more certainty, i'd suggest signing up for vedaprime, it just takes all the guess work out of it.",
645,"if vins only happen after (at earliest) the car is built then they have had rhd production on the 28th, 29th, 30th. hopefully all for au ?!  if its full days then thats about 2k m3s and more mys (i think they had a higher production rate than the m3s even before the shutdown and upgrades).  yeah veda's service will add a little more certainty from various sources but i dont even have a vin so i either dwell on milk choices  or analyse videos and do calculations ",
646,"my delivery date was 18/06/22 in brisbane. i got my invoice and vin on 24/05. from what i recall, the morning clara docked at port kembla around 03/06. build date was 26/04.  hope this helps.",
647,no sign yet of any performance vin allocations in this batch. only lr & rwd,
648,why he hasnt got the vin when dates after him have is the real question.,
649,we're talking vin at present. in response to . we have people in adelaide with no edd but they have a vin assigned.,
650,"called homelink, and let me know what you find out, i also want to order one.... but i'll wait for a vin ...",
651,"hi, ordered m3rwd (melbourne)as standard on 05/02/22… no vin yet. did anyone get vin already for this date or after?",
652,not as reported.  last rwd vin we heard of on here was 18/01 hopefully some next week - at a guess i'd look to tuesday/wednesday (once the factory is back up again),
653,"then my friend, you have been assigned a vin (secretly) and you can find it hidden on the webpage.  your car is on the way  (slowly  but still you have one)",
654, when was the last p vin revealed?,
655,just got this sms today after i found my vin a few days back. so probably things are moving.,
656,"me too, got the vin from vin finder back in 29 jun",
657,woow thats great congratulations mate...... i have ordered the same configuration on 19/1/22 no vin yet ...figures crossed,
658,"paganella is the only boat heading to nz on 6 july, tesla may built for nz market last week first and very small amount for aus. nz mid feb lr m3s have been fulfilled and vin assigned. aus production should starting tmr.",
659,assuming they get to your order in this batch (no guarantees) then you should have a vin and be able to pay in the next few weeks as they trickle out the allocations of vins.,
660,"note, there are people who were assigned vin last weekend too. i personally doubt vin assignment is manual work and should have been processed in batches on remote servers.",
661,i finally got my vin and the final invoice. telling me to pay now.$,
662,that's more likely the vin allocation date.,
663,"so in this case vin was assigned 4 days after production?  if that continues, and the factory opens tomorrow, vins could come at the end of this week or early next week.",
664,vins appear to have been assigned on 28/6 and we have a build date of 30/6. so vin assignment 2 days before production. would love to see more build dates.,
665,"i only got sent my vin today, with the invoice dated yesterday 03/07.",
666,"i want it to mean i'll get a vin soon, but i don't think it does mean that. i hope i'm wrong.",
667,so i spoke to the sa today and he mentioned a few things to me which id love to see if anyone on here could confirm they have recieved the same info.  od for my 3 was 31.01 and my y 10.06 at 10.45. no vins for either.   he mentioned that several “thousand“ vins will get assidned prior to end of the month.  deliveries will happen after august and more likely early to mid september…. if you do not get a vin by the end of the month dont expect a car before december…. :/  lastly he expects vins to start coming out again next week.,
668,"i can't see a vin being allocated in july for a december delivery, just too long between allocation and delivery. vin is allocated after build and based on this logic there would be cars sitting around for months just waiting for pickup and delivery",
669,i think  was saying if you don't get a vin in july don't expect a car before december,
670,"once again the sa feedback coming in all shapes and sizes. some of what he says makes sense. if you don't get a vin in this quarter's production, you won't get one until q4. just depends how many they make this export run this quarter. though elon was talking about moving away from the current production and delivery method this quarter so even that might be based on old methods.  my sa's advice has consistently been that they have access to the exact same order page/info as us and they have no communication about production at all from any source. i believe her. haven't talked to her in a while though.",
671,"yeah that does not make any sense. if you don't get a vin in july, you can still easily get your car before december, given there are no more delays from covid. (jan-march orders)",
672,"so i interpret that as:  we will see what starts coming out, but counter to that we have:  some of those conflict or constrain each other. eg if no vin by 31/07 ... - half of that time the line is shutdown so clearly end of month isnt the absolute limit. delivery early to mid september vs already notified delivery time frames (mid august) - possible different vessels?  either way the next few weeks will be exciting.",
673,"just got a text from tesla saying a m3 has been assigned to my order. no vin in the app or web portal yet. originally ordered rwd white/white - jan 17, brisbane",
674,ah ha! not a new one then. you will have a vin in your source code.,
675,"fringe benefits tax (fbt) – a 47.00% tax on electric cars provided through a business for private use of the vehicle.  that's the exemption, so i'm not sure if a business buying one outright would get any benefit unless they were buying it for an employee to have private use. would have to check in with an accountant on that one sorry. anyway.. i didn't mean to hijack the thread! back to dates and vin numbers!",
676,"i got it figured out.    the reason tesla prioritises manufacturing the model y at the moment is that the model y production line is due to shutdown from the 1st of july till the 17th of july, it needs sufficient y volume for the shipment. meanwhile, the model 3 production line will remain open therefore all prioritisation during the period would be on producing the model 3s.  if i am correct we should see a large influx of model 3 vin allocation within the next two weeks.",
677,can someone  get a new vin already?,
678,"as con the fruiterer would say ""a cuppla days"", you will get a vin that is ""bewdiful"".  as for all the noise, ""doesn't madda""",
679,"i'm seeing a lot of silly talk and not a lot of vin getting from you, .",
680,"mate of mine got his model y vin yesterday. i dont think we can be friends anymore (3 lr 7/jan, no vin) perth",
681,"in all seriousness, my lr 24/01 is about 51 days away from the last vin allocation date for lrs we have so far (4/12), so i'm a fair way off.  i'd love to see more movement but i dont think i'll get a vin soon, maybe next week or the week after if things go well? lots of people in queue before me that have been waiting longer.",
682,next step for you will be a change in the tesla mobile app asking you to accept changed range (602km) and tesla vision. after hitting accept the vin should be somewhere in your webpage (which you now know how to recover).  when that is who knows   but you're 10/12 - 8/12 so 2 order days away from a vin in the lr list. so soon™!,
683,"on the 28th june, 12:30 ish is when the questions for the start of the vin process started.  for the chosen ones.",
684,"also for relevance, order date 19/1 m3 rwd white/black. no vin yet",
685,"hi  would like to thank all the community members for sharing valuable information and suggestions. not a frequent poster but regularly follow all the posts.  need a suggestion regarding my order. m3 rwd | msm | black | 5 seats | ordered 14/3/22 | vin - no  i have been waiting to put in my loan application as my edd says aug to nov, my od was on 14/3 original edd 5-7 months. luckily bought it just a day before the price increases and edd also moved to to 6-9 month.  have been postponing the loan application thinking that would expire if i apply it early but because of that need to pay higher interest rates now. but thinking to apply immediately before the interest rate goes further up and will be able to lock the price 6 months, just worried what chances of me getting an invoice within the next 6 months ?  macquarie and pepper are 4.99%, any suggestions about the best interest rate available at present ?  thanks",
686,do you have you vin or invoice yet? i am also from brisbane,
687,no vin or invoice yet.,
688,"so who with a vin and a delivery date of ~8th to ~18th aug has an actual invoice?  thought i saw some mention an invoice, but i've not got one yet, which feels a bit weird.   i'm totally still 80% expecting something to cause me to miss out this quarter. my faith in tesla remains low. i'm very much in the ""i'll believe it when i'm in it"" realm.",
689,could be different with rwd and lr.  eg so far i've only recorded sms vin notifications coming from rwd people. did you get one? be nice to know lr people got one too.,
690,"from what i've heard, vin only happens after car is built. sometimes its a long time after (eg car is already on the vessel)  so your car already exists. as a blue black rwd you might be able to spot it in the wu wa videos  or at least one that looks like yours  you should have a vin you can discover on your web page.",
691,didnt we find out a few days back that people were assigned vins a couple of days before the actual build date e.g. found vin on 28/6 and build date was 30/6? i thought there were some examples of that,
692,yes i have found vin in source code. i was thinking official vin is in the invoice? no invoice yet. however i did find vin in my “application for vehicle registration” document which appeared in my portal this week.,
693,my edd of 11-21 august has been removed from my login page along with my payment overview and bank payment details. the vin had also gone from source code! i never received an invoice or a text message.  my login page has returned to aug-oct edd.  od 3/12/21 lr w/b  speechless!,
694,is the vin still in that other tesla link that checks the api or whatever it is ?,
695,"painting might take a while to dry??  but the rest would be very quick - giga press ftw  i can see maybe a day to get it going, more likely several hours. but i cant see days.  but taking days for the first vin from the first build to get to us is not only possible but we have seen it before (vins getting notified for cars already on vessels)",
696,18/01 rwd white & black get vin number this morning. will get model 3 & model y same time. oh dear,
697,your vin appeared today? or you just checked it today?,
698,yeah he seems to think otherwise....  are you saying you think your vin will appear today and it has been built since the shutdown??,
699,i got my vin but no invoice so can’t confirm build date. assuming it was 30/6 since compliance shows 06/2022 (rego docs),
700,and note also that the account you pay into should be very closely related to your rn order number.  and if you google the vin you should get additional comfort.,
701,i have questions for magicjai hahah... he said his vin would appear today... like he knew...? or maybe he just meant he found the prompt to accept range change in his app...,
702,just one vin reported today?,
703,"yep. 1 vin on the spreadsheet, date shift of 2 order days probably = about another 50-100 cars.",
704,"why would you consider that to be newsworthy?  tesla consistently build the batch over a period of 2-3 days, and then the vin assignments take weeks post the build date.",
705,"with another rba rise expected in august and one more in q4 potentially, both of which may be as high as another 50bps each, it's worth considering where you're at in your application expiring and what rate you may end up on for sure.  order process was more involved that both pepper and plenti (macquarie ask for more detailed living costs and payslips where pepper and plenti was a basic questionnaire kinda thing). benefit of macquarie is that they hold the rate until your application comes up for renewal. plenti and pepper apply their rate changes to your current application as soon as they make the change.  early pay off fee? i'd have to check, i'm only financing a portion and had no intention of paying it off early so didn't pay much attention to it.   od 10/2, m3p, white/black. no vin (of course)",
706,how long after vin is the invoice normally supplied?,
707,"i've got a vin and final invoice, but no delivery date.",
708,when was the last p vin released?,
709,"i saw vin in source code 30/6, just got invoice today.",
710,so did we legit just get one random vin today on the 20th? what's going on there?,
711,"time for some good old wild speculation!  so 15/01-18/01 orders for rwd mostly got vins on the 28/06-30/06  next batch seemingly started roughly a week later with an order placed 20/01 and if we follow assume the same number of orders placed, this batch might clear out orders upto 23/01..  hopefully i'll something in this coming week for my m3 w/b ordered on the 22nd  no vin or contact as of yet.",
712,"i don't understand how people can say that tesla doesn't build to order... if that were the case then why are the rwd m3's vin allocations in chronological order? surely we'd have some white with black orders filled ahead of say blue with white? that hasn't happened yet, all in chronological order within your rwd|lr|p ranges..",
713," you're so close  mine is from the 29th, hoping to see my vin soon ",
714,so:  order date: 20/01/2022  build date: 4/07/2022 (just as factory reopened so probably very limited run) vin date: 6/07/2022 (12:30pm aest) invoice date: 7/07/2022,
715,that notification in the mobile app and accepting those terms seems to be the current start of the vin assignment process.   sounds like you're right at the front of the queue so keep checking the app each day ,
716,any chance you got a vin today? ,
717,"therefore, has anyone received their vin today?",
718,just got my vin for a vanilla and am feeling the same trepidation ...,
719,"model 3 standard range, order date 17/01/2022, got vin yesterday(checked yesterday)",
720,"hi all,   just found out about this forum and signed up. i am waiting for my m3 rwd - white / basic option with sports wheel as well  od - 23/1/2022 edd - aug-nov 2022 vin - not yet  i will share any updates here which i am hoping to get sometime this/next week.",
721,"welcome  many people are registering their orders here:   there is a link on there (at the top) for a form to modify the spreadsheet with your own details (or edit it again later when you get vin dates etc)  separately, i'm trying to keep a track of the recent vin allocations in this q, but i only record those who have a vin and normally only put the table out when there are updates.",
722,"if we haven't received a vin yet can we expect to get ours 7 weeks from 19/7, 24/7 or 8/8 which is the next ships heading to aus?",
723,"no one is sure.  if you have your vin then its coming (at some point - just becomes a ship spotting exercise  ) otherwise its somewhere off in the future. good news is, those 'in the know' say that vins will be coming out over the next few weeks.  vins also come out while the vessel with the car is in transit already.",
724,happy birthday  good luck on the vin lottery!,
725,"hey guys, good morning. it was sad to see that we only got maximum 1 (maybe 2) vins allocated yesterday.  not to get too many hopes high but we have always seen tesla flirt with us on fridays. we also had the aug-oct delay call on a friday (well at least i did), so let's hope we can get tesla to tease us with more vin allocations today!",
726," i can confirm this! i also clearly remember it used to say ""we will reach out to you to schedule your delivery date...""  but now it says: ""delivery timing will update based on configuration availability. we will reach out to schedule your delivery when your vin is assigned.""",
727,"yep. feb order, and also have this change showing. just need a vin to turn up ",
728,"12:30 is not too far away (fingers crossed), however i'm starting to doubt that even this time means anything now..is this based on previous vin allocations other than the previous batch being assigned at 12:30?",
729, it changed for me. march order...    delivery timing will update based on configuration availability. we will reach out to schedule your delivery when your vin is assigned.,
730,i;ve got the same text on my m3 in march  my my with vin and final invoice also says the same thing  i'd take a guess and say it means nothing. just updating the website to freak people out,
731,same configuration as me and ordered only four days after me. no vin either. here's hoping.,
732,cleared the cache and this is the wording.   delivery timing will update based on configuration availability. we will reach out to schedule your delivery when your vin is assigned.,
733,  noticed this message change too. 18/01 rwd msm (no vin yet),
734,definite change    delivery timing will update based on configuration availability. we will reach out to schedule your delivery when your vin is assigned.,
735,"not the person you asked, but didn't for me. ordered white rwd late jan, changed colour to red in april, retained base pricing (ie didn't get the price increase added) and have vin and aug edd window while april orders don't. electronic order confirmation did reflect the april date, but doesn't appear to have affected place in the queue.",
736,"the vin check url has stopped working for me, am definitely logged in to my account.   ",
737,is there a spreadsheet here tracking all our orders here and vin allocations? someone from the facebook group lead me here. they have a poll going tracking all orders with no vins assigned since nov 2021 to march 2022,
738,"mine has also changed to that, but as i ordered around 5 weeks after you, i wouldn’t get my hopes up too much 🫤 but i might start searching for a vin more frequently (just in case)",
739,i'm just looking at who has the vin allocations this time.  let me know if you get one and i'll put what details you're willing to share on the sheet. not recording anything if you havent got a vin yet.= (ie my name isnt on the list),
740,just notification from pygha that they got a vin yesterday.,
741,"strange thing i noticed about the notice on your order page. when i log in through my phone this appears ( cleared all cache ).  we will reach out to you to schedule your delivery date. delivery time frame is based on order date, profile submission, delivery location and vehicle configuration.  but when i log in through pc it's the other one talking about vin and allocation.",
742,"okay, getting late enough. here is the current list of ppl with m3 vins and some of the details. main update is  's vin - still trying to find out what happened with  's order - last i heard the vin and delivery date disappeared.   so in summary:  rwd: 11/01/2022 -> 20/01/2022 lr: 28/11/2021 -> 4/12/2021 p: nothing so far",
743,correct ormaus….. the vin and payment over view page have not returned to my account.  my edd remains at aug-oct 2022. can’t bring myself to ring my sa. they really can’t do anything anyway.   best to remove me from your list!,
744,"tesla communicates electronically, and you're unlikely to hear anything from them until a vin has been assigned  the lack of communication is one of the big issues with tesla, and why everyone on here obsessively checks their account / source code for changes!",
745,at 9:05. a guy appears to get in a rhd car at the charging stations next to the weird side yard! the dribble of vehicles seems to match the rate of vin allocations however.,
746,"yeah i know. but the fact remains they have barely worked through the backlog in terms of vin allocations so far. which is the issue needing to be addressed.  if the move is to say ""we  build cars for australia"" (no numbers provided). and then only provide 4 days of orders, that's pretty underhanded behaviour and is wholly addressing tesla's optics, not remediating the very easy to understand issue: the entire backlog. in addition to what  described.   the reason it annoys me is because i am paying a company tens of thousands of dollars to treat me (and all of us) like a moron while relying on this cult-esque refusal of fan boys to criticise them (like people would any corporation). basically any other company that ships things will bother to establish, explain and attempt to remedy an issue.   tesla basically serves it's own interests, refuses to serve the customers and then gaslights from there on in.",
747,"thanks, but i copied it from someone else when i first joined.  from all the questions on here, maybe i should add ship docking date, ship unloading date, vin date, and invoice date…. but then no one would talk to me….",
748,"of course, they would be used to and have the demo'd capacity to do double the movement off the lot with y line running. so it could be the case that 1/3 of total production meeting the full logistics = empty lot.  but then the vin allocation numbers don't match and the lhds existing in the vid mean full production isn't dedicated to rhd.  in my mind, the balance of evidence leans toward not that many made for us before m3 line shut down. and am deeply skeptical of these sas saying ""ships and ships of m3s"" still 9 days to go though. would love tesla to prove me wrong!",
749,which is why i am quietly hoping that some vin allocations are done after loading?,
750,"i still don't have a build date, or am invoice. but i've still got a vin and a delivery range of 8th to 18th aug. i should be confident, but i'm not ",
751,had you checked yesterday and had no vin or is this new today? what's the first four of the last six digits? those will define whether its recent build.,
752,i even checked it this morning and it wasn't updated. i have a chrome extention installed which notifies me when a vin is assigned and i got a notice when i refreshed the page few moment ago.,
753,congratulations! you have however ruined my weekend. i had pledged to myself that i would not check for a vin all weekend and have just broken that to confirm no vin,
754,my order page was somewhat little different. it asked me to confirm with the order because the latest models will not include radar etc. i pressed i agree and voila! a vin msg popped up.,
755,"i don't have that confirmation message. my next step --> prepare for delivery  in my account is unticked, unlike my my order. how did you find out your vin and that message on radar? i don't have access to sms for the past 3 weeks.",
756,"i have chrome tesla vin finder extention installed. that gave me the popup message that i have the vin assigned. i found the confirmation message just under the ""next steps"" section on my order page. it is now showing payments. i wonder why it skipped your one tho. i'd imagine you have it very soon.",
757,"if the factory was pumping out 800 cars a day out, then based on my 6001xx vin and 29/6 build date that's a preshutdown vin. assuming sequential vin production of course.",
758,"i was commenting on build dates, not vin allocation dates.  it is widely assumed the serial number part of the vin is sequential, ie a higher vin number was produced later. this does not appear to be the case, if the build date on the tesla invoice is correct",
759,"serial numbers (the last digits in a vin) are mostly allocated sequentially in manufacturing (lowest available number) but from an interview i saw with a tesla engineer, inventory is built up at each of the the panel pressing, body welding and paint shop sections and that's where a vin is assigned to the body. they don't run in parallel with the guts adding line at all.  he was scarce on detail as to exactly where in the panel -> welding -> paint section that the vin is assigned. it takes 12 hours for cars to dry/drip and hardly time on the guts injecting line. so they need an inventory built up at the paint shop rather than running end to end.  before the paintshop, there is another inventory build up of basic panels and components to weld into full bodies.   so they would probably take the next available white body in the inventory to go along the guts adding line. then the next available red. they are probably sequential at some point, but not close to sequential in final build.",
760,"maybe, maybe not. more likely your serial number (the end bit of the vin) was assigned a while back and the rest of the vin was filled in according to the guts it ends up with. the bodies are apparently ambidextrous.  but also assigning a vin to an order is probably a whole other kettle of fish.  to explain. we think like humans (who grew up conditioned with a particular system of writing), not robots. they can print the last bit first and as long as they use the same paint and are aligned properly, can print the first bit last. we assume the vin is written like we read and write. left to right and all at the same time if perceived as one 'word' or 'string'.",
761,it is always a mix of vin frenzy and drip feed.,
762,"i've seen video [unfortunately can't locate again] that shows vin being attached to vehicle when fully assembled dash is installed. maybe the vin structure has already been predefined as  described. but i think vin  comes later. we know that they don't build to order, so maybe after vehicle leaves plant, maybe on board ship? i also think that the qc process [including road test etc] is done before allocation, else we could see vin allocations revoked due to faults being [rarely] detected.",
763,long time lurker here. tesla model 3 lr ordered on 21/12. got vin this morning.,
764,"thought i'd chime in with my details.  m3: rwd white/black 18"" wheels location: perth od: 21/01/22 edd: aug 28 - sep 7 vin: assigned  got the tesla vision prompt when i checked the order page this morning, after which the delivery date changed and vin was assigned.",
765,love waking up to a sunday morning packed with some fast and furious vin non-diesel allocations ,
766,"it looks as if they're rolling through the order dates pretty quickly. my od is a couple of days after yours, and judging from things so far, i'm expecting to get a vin by about the 25th of july.",
767,so we need a vin frenzy before then…,
768,there is a visible vin in the dash you can see through the front windscreen but there is also a vin stamped into the floor of the bodywork earlier in the build process. the two numbers are married during assembly so there is some prior planning to the allocation before final internals. from the latest version of the m3 owners manual:   ,
769," all that really matters is when tesla assigns the vin to a customer and communicates that (even if by hidden code).  historically that's been when the vehicle was already on the water. in this quarter with the late june notifications it appears that it might be just after vehicles pass qc / leave the factory.  as for when the vin is created, remember the vin is stamped into the dash and floor parts, and also contains model codes and motor codes. and i suspect is also associated with lhd/rhd, exterior and leather colour.  the might create a batch of 10k vins at a time - which then drivers the orders for say 7k black seats and 3k white seats at the sub production lines, 8k basic audio wiring looms, 2k premium etc.  and then schedule the production runs to produce it efficiently but also without building too much inventory of parts.",
770,model 3 lr  ordered 7/1 perth black/white vin assigned this morning,
771,"perth has to organise the transshipment boat, so likely earlier vin assignments",
772,od: 20/01 model: lr silver/black location: wa vin assigned today edd: aug 28 - sept 7,
773,"it's not all bad. longer it takes, the more i'll have saved up so the less i'll have to borrow. not feeling nerdy enough to graph it, but i reckon that the amount i'm reducing the loan by should offset the increase in interest rates, and make my repayments about the same.  plus i'm following up on quotes to sell my existing car, and already found offers 2-3x what tesla offered in trade-in.  i have a question for those who already have their car, or their vin, and did financing. at what point did you have the option to start the actual loan? when the vin was assigned? or not until you took delivery of the car?   figuring out the likelihood of being able to keep the lower interest rate. the 6 months preapproval ends the first few days of september, after which i'll have to reapply at whatever the new rate will be by then. if payment/loan can begin as soon as a vin is assigned, then there might be a chance of me still getting the good rate.",
774,perth is definitely the centre of todays vin allocations!,
775,waiting for a vin was almost as bad as waiting for the vaccines to kick in and start reducing cases.   there you go.,
776,happy vin day perth estimated delivery: august 28 - september 07,
777,"could be related, the factory is in china... covid came from china.. vin is chineese for haha gotya!",
778,"yyyyyeeeeeeeeesss vin received!! od: 22/01, edd aug 27-sep 6",
779,there were a few white interiors assigned in today's vin frenzy.,
780,nice choise of colour combo . hope you get your vin allocated soon! ,
781,yappiee checked afternoon today ...can confirm the vin in the source code ....delivery status changed to .... between august 16-26 finally husshhhh... m3 rwd/ midnight silver- black interior/ odd - 19/01/2022  edd- august 16-22 vin- in account page 10/7/2022 melbourne,
782,still waiting!! should have just ordered a short range! checked today no hidden vin  m3 lr sliver\black sydney oder date 7/12/21  like see more lr vin's in sydney,
783,"this is the kinda thing i do not understand, and is really pissing me off (no offence to )... my order was nearly two months prior, i got my vin nearly two weeks ago, we're both in melbourne, but my edd had just been pushed back to longer than yours. was 8th to 18th, now 19th to 2nd. it doesn't make any sense; to match those edd they'll have to be on the same ship, or they're preparing me to be bumped again. if not, why do i get to wait longer still!  i'm still looking forward to getting my car, and i'll love it when i have it, but when it comes to my next car, i don't see tesla getting a look in.",
784,if you got a vin at least you have a car on the way. there is a lot of anxiety with people that don't even have a vin yet and whether they will make this quarter.,
785,"if it's any consolation, the uk orders' edds were jumping all over the place after vin assignment, before they all settled on 3-4 day window in june. as in june, then september, then june, then november, then june again etc etc",
786,yep. lr vins. wa assignments give me a little more hope but it's not over until it's over. as we have all learned over the past year with tesla! not assuming my vin is coming until it's here.,
787,"why are you getting mad about something which not in ur control , also they are called estimates for a reason they swing back and forth all the time, they are just based previous predictions  so you never know when you get the car until you get one. there are all sort of probabilities until you get the handover. so just njoy the movement that you have a vin and car made for you",
788,"hello waiting room  been watching and learning (not in a creepy way) ,in fact it is just about my new favourite pass time!! i ordered my m3p white/white 17/03. i have a question if i add the $5000 drive assist upgrade will it delay my order? can it be paid for with no vin and car?",
789,today was a good day! we saw a lot of vin allocations for a lot of people on this forum throughout all the specs.  hoping for the same or similar response from tesla tomorrow. fingers crossed. ,
790,as a 5/2/22 lr order looking at broony's vin with a fair bit of optimism for once in a long while,
791, as a 9/2/22 i am also hoping for a vin allocation soon!,
792,order date: 6.12.2022 model 3 lr red/black vin received: 11.07.2022,
793,"making sure this isn't a typo. you ordered last month, and got a vin already? very surprising  other than ebizz above potentially, i think this makes you the latest order date for a vin assignment. trying to not get my hopes up for my 04 mar order getting a vin this batch, but the excitement is irrepressible",
794,"thought i’d check the app before going to bed aaaand prompted me to log in and accept new tesla vision!  vin received in source code !!! invoiced received 10/07 25/02 lr white/white perth! edd: aug 28 - sep 7  everyone waiting hang tight! there’s that anxiety you might miss out this batch, just keep your fingers crossed !!",
795,"if someone who ordered the same time as you is getting a car, i'd be confident of getting a vin in the next few weeks.  wa orders are just prioritised due to the additional transhipment time, and tesla's objective of not having inventory at end of quarter.",
796,frustrating that some late feb lr orders are getting vins before dec lr orders. whilst it hopefully means i’ll get mine soon there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the vin issuance which makes it all the more annoying.,
797,got my vin  od 10/12 lr white/white south australia,
798,anyone get a blue or black lr vin yet?  still waiting on mine and seems like blue and black are the only colours without lr vins over night.,
799,and lo on the 214th day since the great acceptance a vin came crackling through the ether. edd: 18-28 august  i hope that this week brings good news for many (and extra work for  ),
800,"received my vin and my beautiful daughter a few hours apart.  model 3 lr blue/black, melbourne. order date 9/12 edd august 17-27",
801,od is 6th dec 2021 edd 18/08 to 27/08 vin assigned: 11 july invoice issued: 11 july,
802,and we have a vin!  lr white with black leather order date: 14/12/21 vin date: 11/7/22 edd 18-28/8/22,
803,missed mine.   vin received today.   lr white/white od 10/12,
804,"checked the tesla app at 5am this mornng (perth time), got bluetooth and vision requests. od 8/2/22 edd august 29-sept 7 lr white/white vin not in source code yet  close...",
805,"woohoo, just got a vin this morning as well - first performance i've heard of unless anyone has also gotten theirs this morning too ",
806,"given all these late february lr vins, i'm now more hopeful i'll get a vin in due course as well. when do we think rwds will start getting a wave of vins in perth (given we seem to get vins first)?",
807,this may get too much for me to track if we get a large dump of them. but hopefully if the sheet only gets to 150 ish it should be good. but at some stage i probably wont post all of it each day. i dont think anyone wants a wall of tesla vin and order details daily.,
808,"after receiving so many vin's in middle of the night, is there anyone still thinking vin allocation is a manual process?",
809,so did anyone in sydney with a lr order get assigned a vin overnight?,
810,i think vin allocation is done by system but my theory is there might be some manual tasks post vin allocation before releasing to a customer . these might be queued to admins to process hence a bit discrepancies,
811,"long time lurker, first time poster. just got vin and tesla vision acceptance. no invoice yet.  lr blue/white od 07/12/21 delivery 19-29 august canberra",
812,"morning. my stupid real job got in the way of this one and i missed the morning vin frenzy!  looking at armacup, it has to be clara, passama or crystal to hit those (admittedly unreliable) edds for perth right? more likely these ones currently being assigned are passama onwards?   might be being popped out of the factory as we speak. and clara will be a bunch of ys and those pre shutdown ones.",
813,yeah i privately track my time to vin by order days in front of mine.  so for lr its 24/01 (me) - 14/12 (marigold - latest non perth lr) = 41 order days away from vin allocation. better than the 51 days a couple days ago   but still needing to stick to that state of zen ,
814,i've completely lost my state of zen now. i could have ordered the lr and had my vin now with the other perth orders 🥹 sa has stitched me up good and proper,
815,"welcome!  they usually reset your order for big changes so i'd go with 12/02.  there are 2 spreadsheets 1) one for everyone to edit (its done via a google form - link at the top left of the sheet) - i don't own this one (or i would have made australia a country! - an maybe nz too. and maybe tasmania  - everyone else would have been grouped in ""not important"" or something), 2) one that i keep locally just cause i was interested if there was a pattern to the vin allocations. this one is originally just for me - can't see an easy way to share it with everyone using excel - so i copy and paste the sheet at what i figure is the end of the day (missed it completely last night!!)",
816,obligatory its 12:30pm - primetime vin time,
817,yeah all us non vin people have that,
818,might do that when i hand over one day. sorting doesnt seem to work as well as excel and we get vin updates in all sorts of orders - so i'm sorting pretty much every time i'm putting one in. ,
819, but even then we have only seen 1 performance vin allocation and that order was made in q4 2021,
820,do we have any melbourne / sydney vin allocations today? or finger crossed at 12:30 pm tomorrow?,
821,"yes, hope some more rwd vin allocations come out soon,   don't want to miss the boat ",
822,"we've heard of one yesterday and seen 3 others today.  overnight perth had lrs allocated up until 25/02. we havent heard of any ps in that batch but maybe there just werent any from the forum with ps from perth in that date range? not sure, i dont track orders before they become vin allocated. the other spreadsheet () might have some more details.  so if it was a perth order then its within the realm of possibility. if not, then less likely but again who knows? maybe the dart hit the bullseye for them?",
823,there were a couple of us - i got my performance vin this morning ,
824,"not quite that simple -i am od 10/12 lr (blue/black) due in canberra but still no vin or even the ""accept lower kilometrage"" message. zen is over-rated!",
825,"maybe i accepted changes too quickly, but with my lr, only recall having to accept tesla vision when my vin came through yesterday?  for the umc, did i miss something? thought if you ordered before they removed them you would still receive it?",
826,"nice one  if you are in wa, have a look at the dot rego (application for vehicle registration) in the document section. your vin should be on the form.",
827,"a chinese sa has indicated they'll be allocating cars to chinese model y orders starting next week. interesting that it sounds like they have visibility of the factory's planned vin allocations a week in advance, because the wording he used is that he could see the exact order for the customer he was talking to in the next week's plans.",
828,does anyone know whether how the vin allocation happened in feb? surely there must be more car coming on the same ship ,
829,let today's vin allocations begin,
830,have you got a vin yet hoopyfrood?,
831,"12:30pm is nearing!   the past two days we did see a lot of vin allocations before 12:30pm, however, today has been silent. let's see if tesla makes some noise today or not.",
832,"i'm not sure the time is relevant. most of the perth vin assignments were overnight. but i'm still finding myself refreshing the page, cause i'm dumb",
833,i have a feeling they are going to be pumping out rwd's this week and we aren't going to see any more vin action until later this week or the weekend,
834,that is unexpected. vins before build??  edit: oh luddo's vin was 11/07. never mind,
835,getting bored waiting for my vin. decided to keep myself amused. play along if you like. might also help us work out some ages here   pick a song title with the word love in it. replace the word “love“ with “vin” or ”a vin”  some i have been thinking of…. all you need is a vin i want to know what a vin is. the power of a vin vin shack tainted vin,
836,some old favourites that have helped me through the wait for my vin….  where is the vin? whole lotta vin vin will keep us together  crazy little thing called vin  as long as you vin me i believe in a thing called vin addicted to vin,
837,mine is end of august. kinda hoping that the vin allocation will be enough to make payment/etc and keep the 2.99%. i think the current rate is 4.99%,
838,i can’t help myself… vin is a battlefield ‘making vin out of nothing at all i just called to say i vin you… vin bites put a little vin in your heart tonight i celebrate my vin what about vin  i bet you can guess my age with that bunch   oh i nearly forgot one of my fave’s… is this vin,
839,very amusing! but how could you possibly overlook ‘greatest vin of all’ ??? ,
840,"vin vin vin by of monsters and men, and also avalanche city, and james blunt, and donny hathaway. seems to be a popular song  ",
841,gosh… this game is addictive!  vin story stupid vin what’s a vin got to do with it as long as you vin me nobody’s vin,

845,“the vin boat”?,
846,not a good day for vin allocation. it looks like no one got anything today. what a sad day. i hope we get at least feb/march orders filled up before they shut the line so all remaining q1 orders are fulfilled and ready for delivery in this quarter,
847,not sure if this has been offered previously.  where is the vin (black eyed peas),

858,"hi   did any one go with pepper money ? what is the maximum term they would lock you interest rate ?   the pepper executive i spoke this morning was saying there is no locking of your interest rate, we will be getting the current interest rate at the time of vin assigned though your application gets approved for a lower interest rate.   any thoughts please ?",
859,"that is the feedback i just got from pepper. i was originally approved at the 2.99%, got notification of an increase to 3.99% about a month ago. had a rush of blood when there was some vin allocations and emailed to confirm my current interest rate - 4.99% . not a deal breaker but still annoying.  have had a quick look around and there is not many better rates currently available that i can find.",
860," that is not good. yes, the best interest rate is 4.99% at the moment( pepper and macquarie), if that is the case i think its better going with macquarie, they lock in your interest rate 3 months + 3 months.   what is your od ? it might might be ok for now but there are chances of the interest rate going up before we get the vin allocated.   i read somewhere in this forum saying pepper were locking the interest rates at least for 3 months, may be its changed now ?",

865,i'm in a boring meeting so i took the data collected by  and put it into a simple table for my head. order year-month by vin year-month.  ,
866,"i don't think this is true, well not for me at least. i placed my order on jan 20th for my m3lr, and i didn't do any of those steps in the account immediately, as i was still contemplating increasing my mortgage or going with car finance, so i spent i would say the better part of a month talking to my finance broker, applying for car finance and also applying to increase my mortgage... so i wasn't sure what to do so i contacted my sa and he said i can complete the steps, select finance and i could leave it until i decide once i get assigned a vin what i was going to do and then let him know (if it was changing from finance to cash etc).. and now, here we are... and i have my vin and delivery date (and it is the same order date range as the rest of the perth order dates getting their vin assigned now too, no delay!)",

879,it's a nice theory hahah and love the optimism - but if that were the case i'd have my vin by now as i'm a perth order ,

890, vin crocodile?,
891,"i've basically resided myself to next allocation now.. 22/01/22 rwd with no vin as yet. i cant see how some units were allocated prior to loading the ship, but then others will happen on the way across?  love to be wrong, but i'm not getting any hopes up.",

895,happy friday everyone. some positive news: dreams can come true...i dreamt i didn't get a vin overnight and guess what - it came true!,

897,"surely i've got a vin coming today if there are lrs in brisbane with od 17/03 getting vins  edit, jumped the gun and read the table wrong",
898,this one i have at home.  combo from extract from  and just writing down peoples vin assigned messages and more recently (10 or so forum pages) peoples orders in signatures and the like.  if you have the skills and care factor to make an au only tracker with self editing etc then i'm happy to send it over.  will keep filtering to vin date not blank and posting daily (when there is a change).,
899,"i got the final invoice last night, the build date is 30/06/2022, but i got the vin number at 28/06/22, how come the vin number comes before the build date?",

902,wow.. is that a march order vin assignment i see???,
903,to take our minds off the vin madness:  how do we go about playing music from a usb with the centre console port no longer doing data? my understanding is there is only one data port in the glove box (used for the camera recordings)?,
904,no vin assign today as well. finger cross for monday 12:30pm.,
905,"so far, this has just been a big vin tease.",
906,"i think the likely situation now is that morning clara has lr, p and some rwd cars on it (these seem to mostly have non-standard wheels) and that east coast vin's will be allocated while the vessel is on the water.  for the ""standard"" rwd's the production line was rumoured to be running up to today so all those will be scheduled to leave on viking passama next week and we will see vin allocations for the perth orders on sunday the same as what happened with the lp and p orders last weekend. then east coast vin's for rwd's will follow once the vessel is on the water.",
907,"i have nothing to base this on, no evidence, just a feeling of zen right now. i believe i'll get a vin tonight",

911,next ship is 19/7 then 4 days later 23/7 ....so basically there should be raining vin hallelujah!!!!!! ....raining vin.... raining vin,
912," when they give you the ""final invoice"" does that mean it has to be paid or start being paid a certain amount of time before picking up the vehicle? or can you wait until a few days (funds are to be cleared 48 hours before pick up, i think)?  i see people are getting the invoice before the vin and well before delivery. i want to hold onto my money as long as possible before pick up. i also don't want to delay delivery if i delay payment.",
913,"a bit of clarification here please... i keep getting this on my chrome extension for the ""vin finder"". i just hope i'm doing this right as i don't normally use chrome , let alone their extensions. is this the (repetitive) result you get if it doesn't find any vin in your account. i'm in training to foist the vin onto veda prime as soon as i get it, but not sure if i'm doing this right!",
914,"this lines up with the widely varying etas that those with vin allocations are getting. two shipments back to back is great, and i remain hopeful for my y as i had my 3 allocated once the car was already on the water.",

926,"oh do you have your vin and invoice already? was going by your signature which still says na.  if you do, then yeah definitely follow up with them.",
927,"the other flaw with crowd sourced data is data reliability.   like, i say this as a completely theoretical, i wouldn't do this and i'm not aware of anyone doing this, but imagine setting up 10 or so different alts. and all of them being here for a lengthy period of time and occasionally contributing in the last 497 pages, enough to look legit. then lying and claiming suddenly they'd all ordered in june and got a vin last night.  would completely throw off the data. and spread a lot of discord and frustration with people who ordered older than that.",
928,"i will be interesting to see if in the morning we hear from people like  (lr 10/12 blue),  (lr 17/12 red), and  (p 20/12 blue) because these are the current outliers.  edit: will post the list closer to midnight to allow any more vin notifications to come in.",

1034,"was checking more than previous days and it finally paid off. just got an update on my tesla app to acknowledge change then, found hidden vin 6099** with build tag of 15/07/22 edd aug 27 to sep 5.",
1035,"i have a crazy theory, don't take my word as it is just a theory.  while the model y vin allocations were quiet (between july the 4th and until now), there haven't really been many model 3 allocations either (the perth allocation started around the 11th of july).  do you guys think the upgrade for model 3 line could have already been done at the same time as the model y?  by the end of the day, the only source of the report which says the upgrade of model 3 is due on the 18th of july was vedaprime, it is not even confirmed on the chinese social media.  vedaprime please do not hate me.",
1036,"i didn’t get my rego prior delivery, but used my vin and let them know the details later, depending on your insurer…",
1037,yasssssss!!!!!  i have a vin !!!  vin: 6103xx edd: august 27 - september 05,
1038,"any idea what the basis of these estimates are, or are they more correctly characterised as wild ass guesses?  it'd be nice, but 10000 cars would be 2 qtrs of supply for both nz and au, and i haven't heard of any new vin allocations for nz (and no armacup shipping scheduled for shg - nz for 4 more weeks anyway). not sure there have been enough vin allocations on the forums to support that many cars going to au either.  the number just seems wildly optimistic.  edit: for context, 10000 cars is two roros of nothing but teslas.",
1039,"i was excited by this at first, but realised it would also be 3-4000 model y's.  i think most people have a build date 2 days before they got their vin. if that is true, and if they are producing 3's for au/nz until line closure than that might mean we have two more days of vin allocation ahead. maybe nz is last, in a similar way that perth was first?  i've got no idea, i just have too much hope and optimism.",
1040,few rwd vin today. may be rwd orders will catch up with lr orders soon. seems like last 3-4 days of m3 productions was allocated to au shipment before the line shuts down tomorrow. hopefully rwd vins keep coming early next week.,
1041,"if they're building them today, it's entirely possible you won't see a vin for a couple of days.",
1042,"the ""estimate"" may well be a pipe dream. my whole point was to question the op view that nothing much had been produced other than the perth cars. the numbers listed here are only a representative fraction of the actual people being allocated cars. not every tesla purchaser uses social media platforms. whilst the vins being reported vary in their sequence it is significant given we started at 589xxx and are currently at 6103xx or thereabouts. his premise that the shutdown starting tomorrow wasn't happening because chinese chats didn't mention it is like saying the labor didn't win the election because facebook didn't have discussion on it. don't sweat it. we'll know the true figures built, shipped and delivered for the quarter once tesla report their figures as part of their production reporting. their push is to make as many cars as possible this quarter to make up for the losses caused by the covid shutdowns during the previous quarter. i was one of those dudded by the lack of planning and covid shutdowns to miss getting my order for 7 months and two weeks. i am happy that i now have a vin and look forward to finally getting my order to drive...",
1043,has anyone got their full invoice with build date with m3 vin today,
1044,all you lucky buggers who ordered in feb getting vin allocations - i had to wait since dec last year to get mine! ,
1045,"i reckon we got one more vin frenzy in the barrel. last few they seemed to fire a few warning shots, things went quiet and then it was frenzy time! yesterday afternoon i was almost certain i was going to miss out. it's not an amazing feeling.  here is an image i found when i image searched ""lucky forklift"":     it's moving a big hat. the bigness of the hat is incongruous with the famed smallness of a leprechaun. for this i have no explanation. you're welcome.",
1046,"blue/white m3p combo here. od 06/02. vin hit in the last hour and on top of that, $2k cheaper. happy days.  first post for me, joined up last week and have been lurking watching the avalanche of vins.",
1047,congrats to all (m3 ps lrs rwds and even mys now) who got their vin over this past few days/week - tesla is going to be back on the top of the austn evs sales charts for aug and sep for sure. i see quite a few teslas on syd streets already and there's going to be more and more in the next couple of months all over aust.,
1048,sorry couldn't update earlier. i received the vin around 2:30 pm today. blue/black rwd canberra. order date 25th jan,
1049,"yeah the invoice should have your build date on it, usually appears a few days after the vin appreance, hopefully.",
1050,"it's happened  got the email tonight to accept and continue. no vin yet.  od 28th jan m3 rwd ms with white interior nsw, over 200km south of canberra so they are delivering it to our home.",
1051,so my mate who ordered his tesla 5 min before me just got his vin but i have not.  od: 5th feb edd: august 27 - 05 sep rwd white/white sydney,
1052,"guys. just thought i'd put this out.   when i received my vin yesterday, the delivery time period was: aug 26 to sep 4  now i just checked my app because i am bored and got nothing else to do and it says: ""aug 26 to sep 3""  tesla may be trying to deliver quicker? that's a first.  anyone else notice their delivery time go down?",
1053,got a vin and delivery date too!!   odd: 04/02/2022 m3 performance white/black  just in time for my 40th bday!!,
1054,"the form to get your car registered before delivery, do we print it up, full in blanks and email it back? if so, who to. or do we take it to a nsw service centre (rta). also, on webpage, it says pay today, looked at bank details but there is no vin yet. would you just wait until vin and then pay? i know this would be asked before but so many pages to troll through. thanks braz",
1055,eagerly awaiting people to wake up and tell me they have vins on feb so i know it’s getting closer to me    also you would think vin allocation might be a day or two behind build date?  so we still might have a day or two of vins?,
1056,i was hoping to see something this morning…but the vin god is silent for the moment.,
1057,"i submitted the rego form after it was requested by tesla shortly after ordering online. after receiving my vin, i got an email to resubmit. the form was available via the portal and the vin has been pre filled",
1058,"so, with vins being received within 48 hours of build and the factory now supposedly closing today that means myself and the others so close to the front of the line have basically today and tomorrow to get a vin or else we have missed the boat, correct?",
1059,"well it hasn’t arrived yet!  so far the only pleasure i’ve received are putting in my order, having my host of accessories and mpp bits arrive, and finally getting my vin ",
1060,this is common. the invoice creation is a piece of administrative work that gets done any time between a day to a couple of weeks after vin allocation.,
1061,"!! yay, received my vin and invoice on saturday, for m3p ordered 08.01.22, estimated delivery due aug 22 - aug 31.",
1062,i see the vin gods may have returned. lets hope all our q1 orders can done.  haha,
1063,i got a vin!!! can't believe this. i was so upset yesterday morning when i saw so many vin allocations that i gave up checking until this morning!  i've updated my signature with the details and both forms.  enjoy your monday peeps!,
1064,i got a vin on saturday. edd: 24 august - 4 sep  hopefully it will comes out earlier as i am seeing lots of people edd is changing.,
1065,"thanks to all who have added information for the order tracking  and . some interesting points of data:  it looks like shanghai have proceeded to model 3 long range and performance models for feb / march orders. for rear-wheel-drive (or sr+ as they were previously called), the latest vin is for an order placed 31-jan-22  new zealand seem to get orders scheduled ahead of au, with the latest nz vin received for an order placed 21-feb-22 (rwd).  the spreadsheet received 6 updates in the past 24 hours with vins received. this info is only as good as the data provided, so please update your records, particularly when you receive a vin.",
1066, thank you so much. yeah mine hasn’t been issued yet. how long does it usually take after vin allocation?,
1067,vins have gone quiet. are the vin allocaters in china sleeping,
1068,"well, it's not that it's impossible, there hasn't been any official announcement of when the line upgrade starts and finishes everything else is just pure speculation based on a piece of leaked memo.  i would think the chance of feb/march rwd getting a vin this round is as slim as an a4 paper. it's okay as it still falls in the initially promised 5-7 months range.",
1069,i am saying we shouldn't lose hope but don't put the hope either. maybe the best way is just to limit our refresh to once a day? your od is very close to the end of jan so for you the chance of getting a vin today is still very high.  realistically it's very likely the upgrade is going to happen. i hope it finishes earlier than 3 weeks though.,
1070,"estimate delivery date finally got updated last night, was almost too excited to sleep. order date 24/1, estimated delivery date 27/8-05/9 sydney anyone know what the next step is? the vin still don't seem to be there, or do i have to finish paying off the car before i get the vin? thanks everyone",
1071,i don’t think i’ve refreshed anything as much as i’m refreshing the tesla app today.   two identical orders me and my mate   od: 5/2 white/white rwd sydney he got a vin last night and i still have nothing,
1072,some vins came through overnight (someone indicated that they had no vin at 10pm saturday but after checking on sunday early morning they were assigned one),
1073,build date 15/7 for a 16/7 vin allocation.  lr w/b  od: 26/1  edd has also crept forward to 18 aug to 1 sept from 24 aug to 3 sept,
1074,and it's possibly still not over for the quarter. paglia on 14/8 and morning clara on 19/8 would still make port kembla by early sep so be comfortable for non wa/tas deliveries in september. so we might see some more production when the 3 line restarts in early august.  as i mentioned earlier in q2 2020 due to covid shutdowns aus cars were made 16-18 may (ie. 2nd month) and shipped to australia from the us (a few days longer) and mostly delivered in june.   and expect your edd to bounce around multiple times once you have a vin - normally just +/- a few days,
1075,you sure your mate didn’t upgrade to a lr or p? no one has yet received an rwd vin with feb od? i would very much hope it’s true… cause i am also waiting for a feb rwd vin… t_t,
1076,od 1st feb  rwd white black no vin yet,
1077,od 31st jan rwd white - black interior act no vin yet,
1078,i just got an invoice now and build date and invoice date are both july 16. vin was received early morning july 17 how am i going to update all the charts?,
1079,i refreshed my account page and it showed up in the list of documents... not exactly spamming the f5 button any more since i've got a vin and now they want my money ,
1080,"also just received final invoice. build date 16/07  received hidden vin only a few hours later at 03:00 on 17/07, so delay between build and vin quite short.",
1081,"yep, i can still see all the details in that url you linked (i.e. my vin etc).  also, to double check for you, i logged out of and back into my account and then refreshed both the user-orders url above and the other one you asked me to test... same result.",
1082,"and received my final invoice with a build date of 16/7/2022. pretty efficient, vin on the 17th, invoice not even 24 hours later.  well this part was efficient, the whole 5 month wait thing not so much.",
1083,"what i think has happened is rwd was done, then lr and p’s and next will be rwd. my friend ordered a couple of weeks before me in brisbane is still waiting for her vin and she ordered a rwd.",
1084,"just adding to the invoices chorus - got mine within the last hour or so. build date is 16/07. got the vin on early 17/07, so that's a quick turnaround.",
1085,"noob question - how can i add a signature? also, can one claim the ev rebate (nsw) only after a vin is assigned/car is registered?",
1086,"invoiced just received, build date 15/07, vin received 16/07, invoice received 18/07. 2km on odometer.",
1087,"i am am beginning to get invoice envy. vin early on 16 jul, sms to tell me that on 18 jul, no bill yet",
1088,i really hope it's not the end of vin allocations. i really want my car!,
1089,not only that. you even got a vin before you order... ,
1090,"random question, but do we know ballpark how long it takes to receive the invoice after a vin has been issued?",
1091,i thought you’d get a vin as there is an m3p with od of 21/2.,
1092,"been thinking. there must be lots more vin allocations this quarter. to just keep up, they need to deliver a quarter’s worth of orders each quarter, otherwise the backlog just grows and grows.  so far this quarter, lr & p orders have somewhat done that. they’ve been allocated from early december through to mid feb? not quite a quarter but getting close. rwd aren’t even close. allocations are from early jan to early feb, with quite a few jan still outstanding. . so clearly they need to deliver a lot more rwd this quarter just to maintain current backlog let alone reduce it.",
1093,i got vin in source code sat night/sun morning but nothing else since then,
1094,"weird i am about 48 hours since vin but no invoice just yet, maybe they don't want my money that badly",
1095," my vin appears in code late june, but account has been saying we'll shortly upload an invoice ever since,",
1096,rwd melbourne od 01/02. no vin in source code either. when does it actually show up in source code ?,
1097,"correct. although, there are tell tales in the account. ie you get asked to accept some changes. this seems to happen as soon as the vin is assigned and in the source code",
1098,"seems like the first indication you should get is a message in the app where your delivery date normally is. it'll say something like you need to go to your account because tesla have made some changes. there you will accept the tesla vision change (camera only - no radar). then, once you have accepted the changes, you have basically accepted the car with the tesla vision system and will be able to find your hidden vin in the source code. so the easiest way to see if you have a vin is to pull down on your car in the app and refresh it there until you see that message. realistically, simply opening the app should have the same effect.  edit: i am only summising what i have been reading here in the forum over the last 300 pages since i ordered my car and joined.",
1099,pretty sure the tesla vision change would come up in your web page at the same time as the app says something has changed go to your account page (web site) but either way tesla vision first then accept then you should be able to find your vin  i had the vin finder extension for chrome and once i hit accept (tesla vision) it popped up even before the page had finished refreshing.,
1100,i have a confession to make... now i have a vin i've moved to phase 2 of accessory purchases  i keep looking at more accessories - trying to resist phase 3 ,
1101,"hey gang, long time lurker.  thought i’d join the roulette of emotion that is this waiting room.  m3 rwd b/b ordered: 01may22 location: brisbane  i’m confident, with my half full glass i’ll get a vin this year. ",
1102,i reckon anyone who ordered before 31 may will get a vin this year. this is just my guess though.,
1103,i wouldn't start melting down yet... we saw vin allocations before during and after the clara was docked and loaded.,
1104,"i think you are in with a realistic shout of a vin this year, i expect april 30 orders would be quietly hopeful with the amount of february orders that have cleared out so far...and you're only a day off april...do definitely stick with the glass half full ",
1105,"invoice received this morning, build date 16/07/22. odometer: 2km m3 rwd white/black | melbourne od: 29/01 | edd: aug-oct 2022 | vin date: 18/07/22 edd: 20/08-03/09 build date: 16/07/22",
1106,you could be right. edd changed from 6-9 months to 9-12 months somewhere between 28/4 and 2/5. i was watching closely around that time. so vin for the orders around those dates can possibly come in this year,
1107,"g'day team - just a quick update & reminder to check out the model 3 order tracking  and fill out your details in the  if you have a new order or updated vin / build / delivery date.  over the past 24 hours we received 20 updates to the spreadsheet. 12 of these had vin dates, 10 had build dates, and 3 had delivery dates. most were long range models, but there's a couple of rwd's with recent vin dates from the weekend.  this is some great info to help us all feel better about our delivery prospects, so thank you and keep updating it when you receive more info! cheers.",
1108,same. now i’ve moved on from vin anxiety to invoice anxiety.   when will it endddd!!,
1109,"i feel like we might have walked here before, say 2 or 3 months ago with  denial phase. yes the pain is real but as we’ve just seen eventually the vin will come and you’ll forget about now.  just like everyone who now has their vin and is focused on the invoice arrival.    i’m here with you - sharing the pain.",
1110,how long does it take from hidden vin to invoice? has anyone been able to start their loan early on 2.99% with invoice and vin prior to delivery?,
1111,"i dream of invoice and delivery anxiety, that would be heaven to me. happy for people that have moved on from vin anxiety",
1112,"i am following delivery statistics from xiaote.com (a chinese tesla community). note: there's a distinction between vin allocation and delivery. in the chinese domestic market, the gap between the vin date and delivery date is much smaller but there's still a gap.",
1113,"in the meantime, the model y waiting room is getting quiet as well. there hasn't been vin allocation either.",
1114,"i feel like i'm missing something, but can someone educate me on why everyone who has received a vin is so very keen to get their invoice asap?  is this to lock in finance, or another layer of 'proof that you're actually getting a car' or what?",
1115," red/white here. probably not a good example as my order date was a few days later than some who got q1 deliveries. my vin was one of the first noted here in the current batch, but i would have been very near the top of the rwd list anyway. but 3 weeks since i got the updates and vin in source code, still no invoice",
1116,cheers. my car isn't due to 2023 so no vin or invoice concerns here yet...i was just interested as black/red with white interiors seems to be the least popular by far so was just curious what that meant for orders. i'm guessing there's no rhyme or rhythm to it and no one can really predict.,
1117,"according to tesla and macquarie, they are able to start the loan at the fixed interest rate when the vin is allocated and invoice is generated and provided to macquarie",
1118,black with white m3 rwd. looks like i got my order about the time in relation to the order dates of others. ordered 28/1 - vin - 17/7,
1119,"after reading a few prior posts i called my sa to see what's up. he reckons there is still a big chunk of allocations to occur over the next week. i asked him how vin assignments happen, he replied that it is all automatic as they come off the line. i also asked what the back log is which he only said lots. anyway, gave me a bit more confidence when he said i should expect a car early september, so lets see how true that rings.",
1120," i was thinking about this. and someone probably already has had the same thoughts/discussion but maybe when they shut down production they only close a certain part of the factory for work. maybe there is cars that are built but need to be tested and qa'd before they actually get the tick of approval and a vin allocated to a customer. i don't know what the rejection rate would be (presumably low) but if they assigned vin's as a car popped out the factory door before any testing that might be a bit risky on their behalf. lots could still happen between then and loading onto a ship, even then that's not a guarantee of safety for the car. that also might explain why many here have said previously that vin's are assigned once its on board and sailing!",
1121,"hey . you joined vedaprime the other day. are the methods taught actually tracking your vin properly or more ""s'probs on the passama based on the build date, edd and armacup schedule. its currently dilly-dallying about in the cjk anchorage"" using a marine tracker?  like does it check manifests or anything additional?",
1122,order and vin allocation list updated in ,
1123,i got a vin in source code last sunday but still no invoice. thought it was the trade in,
1124,"i just saw someone in a facebook group say they got assigned a vin for a lr, od: 20/02. maybe meaning they still have cars that are produced and are assigning them. come on rwd",
1125,we have no vin assignments for cars built on the 17th,
1126,do you think we have another round of vin assignments happening for q3 delivery?,
1127,a tesla sa told another forum member to expect more vin assignments this week... any merit to that?,
1128,"while on the whole novated lease, fbt thing. when i was talking to my sa yesterday about vin assignments, i briefly brought up this subject. he mentioned in passing that going that way, we wouldn’t be eligible for the nsw ev rebates. anybody know if that’s true and if so why that might be? $5500 up front is puts quite a sizeable hole in the benefits if true.",
1129,"quick question, how long does it take to get invoice after vin is assigned.",
1130,"within a few days seems typical, but it clearly varies. my vin appeared 16 jul, was notified by sms on 18th, still no invoice. others had an invoice on the same day.",
1131,"mine took just over a week - i got my vin in the code monday morning, 11-july, then got my invoice yesterday evening (19-july).",
1132,yeah let's keep this line open for vin allocations ,
1133,use the tracker and add it yourself. i'm happy to put on my spreadsheet but its purpose is largely over - it was all about teasing out vin allocations. will keep it going till i get my car.,
1134,"in the contrary, i think a waiting room is perfect for speculation of factory shutdowns, vin allocations, deliveries and invoicing due to the lack of communication from tesla.  on the other side of the coin, answers to an fbt exemption legislation, , as well as general accounting, should be deemed as financial advise and should be provided only by those who hold a certificate of a professional accounting body. . i am not even questioning if an online waiting room is an appropriate place to answer them.  my advice is, that financing a vehicle, as well as the related accounting strategy is a big decision and should only be consulted with your paid accountant, that's when the advice really counts.",
1135,looks like vin season is over. discussion has moved onto trunks and frunks,
1136,".. so cars that are built and at the loading dock and only once they're loaded onto the designated ship destined for the market, only then the vin is flagged/allocated to ordered spec, no?",
1137,"no, mine has a build date of 15/07, and i was notified & invoiced on 16/07 (the next day),. seems like a quick and efficient process, giving us our vin and edd as soon as the car is built.",
1138,my initial optimism that the rwds would be getting some love this quarter has started to fade with the vin allocations stopping and the rumoured/100% happening/not-really-sure m3 line shutdown.,
1139,"g’day. recent stalker, first time talker.  ordered an m3p 28/4 after a mate took me for a drive in his m3 (he hasnt shut up about it since he got it oct last year).  admittedly, i didn't understand it till i experienced it and then i got it.. up until then i thought hybrids were the way forward for next few years.  anyway, on the sa experience, mine was responsive with my query last month. suggest maybe they’ve got some tasks on the go now with some cars on the way.  in any case, whether i’m waiting for a vin or a response from an sa.. patience is the virtue.",
1140,"we've had some good interest in the  and  since this local version went up - roughly 2.5x times as many people looking at the spreadsheet as have looked at the form.  by the looks of submissions, vehicle production for right-hand-drive m3's has shut down, the last vin date update is identified as monday 18th july, and given that was two days ago, i think we would have at least heard of one or two more if production had continued.  but still, everyone loves data. at least, i think a high proportion of us in this forum do. so please if you haven't provided your info, and you're happy to give away just a little bit of info publicly, please fill out the form         anyone with any suggestions - what useful charts would you like to see (like, the one below)? any improvements you think should be made, please feel free to message me.     cheers!",
1141,anyone else received their vin in the source code but no invoice?,
1142,fingers crossed for some more on-water vin assignments ,
1143,final invoice and vin received this morning od: 14/03/22 edd: aug 21 - sept 04 m3 p canberra,
1144,awesome! hopefully we'll see a lot more vin assignments today for m3p's ,
1145,"you ordered the same as me, one week later, but are now getting it 2 weeks before me. i am guessing that you are getting someone's canceled order, rather than a new vin assignment ""on the water"".  congrats!",
1146,01 march od. vin allocated!!!! just practicing my post for 6 months time.,
1147,what about the rego auth form in your account?   has anyone been contacted by their sa about returning that after the vin was assigned? i made the assumption and emailed it to them but have not heard anything from tesla outside the standard sms.,
1148,did you get an email from tesla with the rego docs as an attachment? the initial docs you signed at the order stage are for the home address and licence details. they send another via email with the vin and car details that you complete and return to the email address of the sent docs. in my case the return address was .,
1149,"i had a rego form uploaded after the vin allocation (qld). that form was part filled but mangled some details and would be unusable anyway. i had done all this paperwork in person with my sa on the day of order (vin excluded obviously). he advised that nothing more was needed (i had to contact them): so they still have the original correct, signed form. perhaps this applies to you.  if you have never done rego paperwork then certainly time to call your sa.",
1150,ive had a delivery date and have accepted the new terms approx a week ago. still no vin and no invoice. wondering what the hold up is. is anyone else in similar circumstances?,
1151,"have spoken to the tesla rep, and it seems the vin matching is still ongoing so don't give up hope yet.",
1152,"definitely agree with your sentiments, as a march 13 order i feel the waiting room is definitely the place for speculating , keeping spirits raised and passing on vin numbers to those waiting in limbo and hope of a vehicle this year.",

1154," go to your tesla account page and manage your order (as normal). then open this url  you can open it in a new tab and it should also work. the output is a json file, so if it doesn't display nicely in chrome you can add an extension to chrome.  i use this in edge (which is built on chromium of course) ... json beautifier & editor ... and i get this in my browser (just a snip ... the rest of the screen shows your 'rn' and options etc) ...

1155,"i have contacted tesla delivery advisor and trde-in advisor regarding registration document highlighted. if you finished registration document just after your order made before, you can ignore it as they have all of your information. if not, delivery advisor will contact you. the document is for showing your car’s vin and engine number detail. according to them- for the actual delivery, an sms will be sent with 3 days of pickup window. stay back and hang in there!",
1156,delivery date bought fwd significantly overnight.  was aug 24-sep 8 is now aug 13-27. still can't find a vin and need to sell my current sr+ as part of the conditional loan approvement but am kinda nervous about selling without a vin,

1163,"has anyone done any sort of analysis of expected output of known au productions days v known vin allocations? obviously there would be a lot of extrapolation and guess work, but i would be interested to see if the known production is accounted for with vins or if there are still vins to be allocated either at sea or waiting at the factory or dock.",
1164,there's a new trend to start - vin reveal party!,
1165,so i reached out to my sa as i still cant find my vin and was starting to get worried. theyve advised i have one. kinda odd given i can't see it with either of the known methods. either way away we go ,
1166,"my edd has come forward from 23/08-05/09 to 08/08-22/08. (still no invoice and received hidden vin last sunday)  can the shipping experts here advise what vessel that might be on? to my novice eye, it looks like potentially morning clara arriving pk 29/07?",
1167,"i have some new charts from the spreadsheet data. these can be viewed in the , and will update as more people enter their order details.          i'm going to add some more charts to highlight the difference between orders placed vs. orders with vins - hopefully a visualisation of the different data points (trim, paint colour, state) - and whether any conclusions can be drawn from the data point and vin allocation.",
1168,that happened to me too when my vin was assigned buy came good after a couple of days. wierd hey....,
1169,finally got my invoice looks like build date is 15/7 vin on the 16/7,
1170,got my invoice finally on 20/07/22 vin -10/07/22 build date - 09/07/22,
1171,"optimistically, i'm hoping for some m3 rwd vins this weekend. hey, i'd even be happy if the vin allocations didn't reach my order date of 19/2, as long as we see some movement this weekend for folks further back in the queue than me. at least we could all see some m3 rwd progress.  the above is my heart speaking. my brain says ... ""nope, not going to happen mate - it's looking like september""  btw, it's 11:45. only 45 minutes to go until 12:30. stop it heart ... listen to your brain !!!",
1172,"so...i just ducked into tesla parramatta nsw, as i was torn between whether to stick with the msm or to change colour to blue. whilst i was there, talked to 2 x sas and they both said that tesla bases production on forecast not build to order (i think most know that by now but anyway). they both stated that realistically you should not think of the model 3 queue as 1 queue but rather multiple different queues broken down by p, lr, rwd and then colours for each of the vehicle types. your order date is only relative to the other people in your vehicle and colour type. makes sense, most probably already knew this but just thought that i should pass on any tidbit of information that comes to light.  bottom line - decided i liked the msm best and am sticking with it. based on the data we have from  the last vin for my queue is 1st feb so it looks like i'm only a week off the order dates.",
1173,"what do i need to join your service, is vin enough?",
1174,from what i understand for me in adelaide it’s 5 weeks from when the car arrives in australia. then add on shipping time and it could be over two months from vin to delivery. ,
1175,"much like the model y thread, it looks like vin assignments have stopped? so no hope of any new vin's on morning crystal?  which means paganella and morning clara are our last hopes for q3 shipments. interestingly they are both departing on the same day: 19th of august.  maybe tesla are doing a big double batch for australia before they cut over to domestic production to finish off the rest of the quarter?  guess we will find out in 3 - 4 weeks time.",
1176,ah ok. i’ve gone from vin anxiety to ship docking anxiety ,
1177,"o based on your vin date, my guess is your car is not on the same boat as the others who‘ve had their dates pushed forward.",
1178,"anybody know why tesla seeming have gone back to the 3d5 motor?   just looking at my vin lrw3f7frxxxxxxxxx and i'm perplexed why the 8th digit isn't a ""s""..  my understanding was that they all went to the newer hairpin motor as of 22? it better bloody still be able to hit the advertised acceleration    did other rwd owners this batch (and the last) get the same ""r"" 8th digit?",
1179,are you sure that’s not the 3d6 motor? anyone got a unicorn model 3 vin to verify? if it is that’d be awesome. much higher power output.,
1180,this is the vin of our 2021 sr+ unicorn (bigger battery same acceleration) at work: lrw3f7fj7mc392xxx,
1181,"my pre-approval with macquarie expires beginning of september. after reading here, and considering, i've decided the odds of seeing my early march od vehicle arrive before then as slim to none, so will lose the 2.99% interest rate. interest rate is currently 4.99%, and very likely to rise again. i've started the process with macquarie of restarting the approval process to lock in the 4.99% interest rate. i feel super confident that i'll have the car before this would expire (end of january 2023).  but now, of course, cause the universe has a sense of humour i'll get a vin tomorrow and my car will arrive mid august, and i'll have the higher interest rate cause i didn't want to gamble. you're welcome, feb and march orders ",
1182,"so call to arms ... those lucky folks who have won the vin lottery in the last few weeks or so, can you post your 8th digit please? let's see what we can deduce from recent shanghai builds.",
1183,get ready for the vin storm!!! ( probably more y's then 3's though ),
1184,"just spoke to an sa. after telling me for months that i'm going to get a vin in july for a q3 delivery she has just told me if you fell short of being matched with a vin in the last few weeks then you're in for a q4 delivery.... ""sorry for any inconvenience""",
1185,"just found this on whirlpool, i don’t know if it is valid or correct.  “my vin is a 382xxx with the j engine. the j engine has always been the 3d6 p engine with 239kw of max power. there is another hairpin engine, the 3d7 b engine with 208kw of max power, but this one has only been seen on lr models, never on the sr+.”",
1186,"fyi, my earlier post (wanting to end my macquarie pre-approval at 2.99% which ends in september, since i know the car won't arrive before then, so i could lock in the current rate). i've been informed by macquarie this isn't possible. so when my approval ends in september, i'll have to reapply at whatever the rate is by then.  ymmv, but the individual i talked to indicated that once i had a vin and tesla did the final invoice, that is when they could release the funds - even though it effectively means beginning to pay back a loan on a car before you have the car.",
1187,post #12000. i wonder if this will give me luck and a vin assignment? seems just as random as previous assignments so ,
1188,"been wondering about known au production days v’s the vins allocated so far, so thought i’d look at the numbers.  pre-shutdown m3 capacity was 5500 per week.  we know there was a couple of days of au production, just prior to shutdown. we also know au production happened from the initial m3 reopening on 5/8. there also seems to have been limited production after an early re-opening on the 4th, but we won’t worry about that for now. production continued right through to 17th. so in total thats 15 days of known au production.  so potentially there *could* be 11875 m3‘s produced for australia.   so how many vins have already been allocated? dunno. anyone’s guess really, but i would suggest way less than 11875.  i think we can assume in general now that orders exceed deliveries each quarter. q1 2022 there were 4417 deliveries. orders per quarter, may be 5000-6000? vin allocations so far this quarter are a little bit hit and miss, but are clearly less than a quarter’s with of orders. some where in the order of a month to 6 weeks at most. so my guesstimate is that we have about 2500 vins at most so far.  so where’s the rest of the m3’s? possibilities include:  my optimistic hope is that there is some of each of those at play, so therefore there are still some vins to be allocated for cars already produced.  obviously, this is all speculation, based on a few tid-bits that we know for sure. happy to be corrected on any of the details or assumptions.  what do you all think?",
1189,can anyone pls tell me when is the latest order day for the people who got vin already? waiting for my awd in brisbane,
1190,"wo, wo, wo. hold up. did you just say you got a vin for a rwd with od 13/3/22? where are you located and what's your colour spec?",
1191,i think that rwd is an error - order date duplicated in the vin date column,
1192,can't actually see a vin mentioned here. i think snoopy was just getting a smile from the giphy clip .. i certainly did as well.,
1193,finally received my invoice a few weeks after getting vin in source code - thought it was never going to come.   build date 16/7 so looking like viking passama i reckon?,
1194,i'm hoping i get a vin for my birthday in late august.,
1195,best to think of it not as a singular list but as multiple lists.  so there is a specific m3p blue/white queue for which the latest order date i have recorded that has a vin is 6/02/2022 (bartw). i haven't even been tracking wheel choice so that might add to the number of queues too. further there has been some perth orders brought forward to add to the confusion.,
1196,i got a vin the day after my birthday and found out later the car was built on my birthday.  good luck to you!,
1197,"you can get the insurance just on the vin and update the rego later. we all had to do this for canberra deliveries for a long time, because tesla weren't registered as a local dealer and the car would be delivered unregistered to our address.  that said, i'd still not leave payment until the absolute last minute if it were me.",
1198, i have a vin and my edd has remained stable for ages: 9-19 august,
1199,i got that same message and for an instance i thought it was a vin allocation message ..,
1200,i think that we will have a couple of days of vin for 3’s when the line reopens and will be on the same ships as the new y’s coming,
1201,"the whole dash assembly and wireing harness, steering linkage and colloum would be different however the indicater stalk is on the off side so there is something there. you would think that standardization for the body and sub-frame would prevail but its possible there are l and r bodies for mounting points. its possible that the vin is the first part of the construction. i think parts manufacturers have the stock and shanghai throw it all together ...one every 44 seconds.!!! (after the paint has dried)",
1202,"thats ""roos revenge"" if it were the 3 lr you would have to keep blowing it up with the pump till you got to a service station or phone reception. notice that yours and mine could be on the viking passama just off the qld coast of rockhampton vin same date (could be twins)",
1203,"the main frame of the 3 is designed to be agnostic in relation to the location of the driver. the firewall has two identical openings for the steering components. on each version (l or r) the unused opening mounts the mcu and the associated liquid cooling pipes for the mcu. pedal mounts are also the same for each side and duplicated in the pressings. layout of the hv battery, the battery penthouse and 12v battery outlets are identical for all variants. all chassis electrical to the front of the car run through a tunnel in the frame. the only difference there is that the tunnel carries the power cables for the extra front motor for the lr and p models. everything else is identical for all variants. the dash is the only major component that is specific to each version and that slots in during assembly to marry the dash vin to the chassis vin. there are differences like drivers seat which has lumbar support where the front passenger does not but these are minor compared to the overall build.",
1204,m3p ordered 16/03 still no vin assigned *twiddles thumbs,
1205,do you mind telling where you found the build date info?  i ordered 12-feb for a red m3lr (melbourne) and i have a edd of 17 aug - 31 aug.  but i'm unable to find the vin from the tesla page source. i found the vin from this url - ,

1212,"evening guys n' girls! a bit late reporting here, but wanted to share that i've 'magically' received a vin and tentative edd (11/08 - 25/08).  m3lr white on white all standard od 10/02/2022 (original wait est was 14 - 20 weeks) 2.99% finance.  has been a whirlwind of activity, received a text message @ 1:01pm on 02/08, checked my tesla app and sure enough, asked me to log into my account to accept changes (tesla vision & range drop) - done. shortly after that the lovely sa who returned from her much deserved leave called me up to also confirm and let me know - finance underwriter called me up yesterday to request settling early ahead of delivery to avoid having to extend another 90 days.  have made a part payment (on deposit) will finish that up soon, now i've just got to complete the registration forms for the rta - ahh and then there's comprehensive insurance.   checked in on our awesome forum on tuesday but noticed an absence of 'i got vinnnn spam' so...looks like someone cancelled their order?  (to whomever you are out there, i am sorry but thank you and i will ensure that i will enjoy this beautiful gift on your behalf! may fortune and prosperity find you yet wherever you may be! )  for all that are looking on and waiting, hang on in there! your time will surely come!

1214,"ok, that’s it…. until i get my vin notification, i’m changing my profile pic, and holding my breath from….. now!……. and…. i’m summoning the super powers of the mighty mekon to help. (he’s a really bad dude… just ask dan dare)",

1219,"when my vin arrived this morning and given the delivery window, i was assuming it was the start of a new production run. now given the passing of a few hours and no sign of any further vins, including the facebook groups i’m in, i’m beginning to think this may be a re-allocation? if so, maybe my delivery window will bump forward a bit as it approaches?  would much rather see evidence of a new vin avalanche, but just very relieved for now!",
1220,"hey blaq,  interesting similarity in our orders. my m3 lr order was 14 days before yours, have vin and about 2 weeks away from delivery my my p order was 1 day after yours, edd is months away, your order has vin.  schoolyard trade? just like footy card days!",
1221,omfg...got the vision thing-a-me and edd september 14-23. i am in a state of shock.  edit: and a vin in the code thingy ,
1222,"just wondering if when people who recently got vins used the url  to check for a vin did they have the year field in the response filled in saying 2022 before the vin was allocated?  mine is blank and it kind of makes me nervous when i have a room full of accessories that fit the 2022 model 3 that they are leaving it open that it might be a slight variation with a 2023 model that they deliver (and who knows what small changes they might make). i'm pretty sure my mid feb order will come this year but tesla generally make tweaks between 3rd and 4th quarter from what i've seen.  it has fields like the following which indicate that it's a model 3 for australia and my order number (redacted), etc, etc but year is """" which i'd think means it's undetermined at this point in time: ""year"":"""",""model"":""m3"",""vin"":"""",""rn"":""rnxxxxxxxxx"",""countrycode"":""au"",""imageurl"":...  it's probably blank for everyone, but just curious if others have seen it have a value prior to the vin allocation.",
1223,it was all blank prior to vin assignment.,
1224,got my vin yesterday has 2022,
1225,hoping for a vin storm tomorrow as shanghai is back to full production as of today.,
1226,"the car build is relatively short.   from my understanding the longest part is waiting for paint to dry on the body. the assembly after that is about 90 minutes. then testing etc. they may have sped all that up after the upgrade - difficult to tell without another one of those factory walkthroughs where tesla answers questions etc.  as above, they dont build to order but build based on the stats for a region.  the vin is generated as part of the build/assembly process and later on allocated to a person based on configuration, region, and eventually the order date (some people say a dart board is used in the allocation process )",
1227,which would leave us essentially where we are now. with multiple queues and the last order date a vin has been allocated for each queue making the end of the queues look like a sawtooth.  furthermore if it is most efficient to create sets of say 8 bodies of a single external colour then this exaggerates the differences in the individual queues. and assuming the factory works off a variation of jit manufacturing (with a smaller imho) warehouse nearby (thanks wu wa video) then any supply chain disruptions to parts/materials specific to a combination will change the build orders for that period of time. eg if blue paint had a 2 week delay then they would just build other colours for a while.  thus they really dont take the next order off a singular queue and build that but would base it off the stats in the current queue for the region they are building it for.,
1228,"you are absolutely right. there's no absolute confirmation that the upgrade has been finished and since model y has finished the upgrade a couple of days earlier, there's an even chance of being early or late.  12:30 pm vin allocation was a joke from the beginning but i like to tell it again and again.  finger crossed at 12:30 pm today again.",
1229,"just got the official sms notification that a vin has been assigned, but no invoice as yet",
1230,"mmm'kay speculators give me your thoughts. i got my vin on friday night for a july build rwd, so seems to be a reallocation/cancelled order. my edd seems a little weird - 14-23 september. wondering if this means it is on the way with the august deliveries but gets held back in a naughty corner for some reason? anyone else this edd (i couldn't see any on the spreddy but then again my eyeballs are tired).",

1236,fyi - you didn't obscure your vin where it's printed just under the search bar.,
1237,i think you only get 5 or 10 minutes after you post it to make changes. maybe one of the mods can delete it for you.  either that or you'll just have to cancel your order and ask for a new vin ,
1238,my vin has just popped up on this!  it's happening!,

1242,depression - i've got my vin and invoice but no communication on delivery dates on account or thru sa. all i've been told us because it's coming from sydney on a truck to cairns they'll 'let me know'. i don't think it's going to happen and i vacillate between depression and anger from the lack of communication,

1245,i hope so! maybe a vin bonanza next friday 19/8 ,
1246,so... no vin storm yet...?,
1247,yeah hence my guesstimate for when we would hear of new vin allocations around 19/8 (friday). in the last run of vin allocations on 15/7 and 16/7 (circa page 500 of this thread) the vessels were set to depart between 14/7 and 19/7. if tesla allocates model 3's on any of those ships i'd hope that we'd know about it come next weekend!,
1248,"i wonder if these dates are why we haven't seen the aus vin storm yet since production restarted. a full shipload of model 3s is less than 2 days production run, and they wouldn't want to have a bunch of rhd cars sitting around clogging the yards before the ship arrives. hopefully they've scheduled a run of aus cars just in time for rolling onto the next ship or two!",
1249," i think those vic teslas were the sr+/rwd ones which arrived in melbourne on morning clara (her departure from shanghai lined up with the build dates for those models). the lr and maybe p orders who have vins have build dates after she left and are most likely on viking passama, so once those are offloaded on saturday we should hopefully be seeing delivery texts next week. seems like tesla have changed things from previous quarters and our cars are now being offloaded at melbourne instead of port kembla. although not sure if all melbourne sr+/rwd orders who were on morning clara have gotten their texts yet.  edit: the rav portal just updated and my vin has been registered today (11/08), not sure if that’s indicative of where it is though ",
1250,my vin has just shown up on the rav. not sure what that means in terms of timelines but i'll take it as another shuffle forward towards the finish line.,
1251,"correction, just checked rav and my m3 vin entered on 11/08/22 ",

1253,"my vehicle shows up on the vin search on rav website now, generally how long does it take to ship to alexandria and a delivery text sent out?  edd is 13th-27th on this month.",
1254,"just check rav, vin found! hopefully sms will follow soon",
1255,when will the vehicle appear on the rav? records of vehicles entered on the rav can be found via the publicly accessible rav search function. records of new entries are transferred to the public search database at 12 noon and 6 pm daily aest (1 pm and 7 pm aedt). the rav is searchable only by the vin and only one vin at a time.  could be a batch of vin's processed in about 1hrs time!,
1256,yeah its just hard to work out the process of delivery and a time line. do they register it first and then notify an sms or reverse. its just been such a long wait and to sail off $80k or so and all you have is a vin number is a little counter intuitive.,
1257,yes he does. i used to be active on this forum but once i got a vin i switched to vedaprime. he does not know everything but his information is either accurate or has logic (not speculation). the quality of conversation on his discord channel is also good and much better segmented than this forum. if you do not want to discuss tint-wrap or insurance you can mute those channels etc.,
1258,"if the vin is found on the register of approved vehicles does this mean it's already landed in port, or could still be on the boat?",

1281,"hey guys first time poster, but i logged on this morning and i now have a ed. details are od 13 march m3 lr silver edd 21 - 30 september  vin found in the code. delivery location canberra  happy times",
1282,invoice received with vin in source code! lr white/black od: 13/3 vin: 13/8 edd: aug-oct location: melbourne,
1283,hopefully a rwd vin flood is imminent!,
1284,"hey stan, my vin is 6103 allocated a week ago with a build date of 16/7. seems mine might be a reallocated cancellation. given yours seems to be the only rwd lately i wonder if yours might be the same? the good thing about that is hopefully your car is already well on the way here rather than just leaving the factory. will be interesting to see the build date on your invoice.",
1285,my vin is 6107xx so not clear evidence of a new production run. invoice is probably 24-72 hrs away.  @ picked up a rwd reallocation recently. what are your first four vin digits?,
1286,"perhaps this has already been shared, but by placing your vin in this search tool, ( molace.com/trk/search) , you can find out which ship your tesla is on. my rwd od23/1 build date 16/7 arrived on euphony ace in port kembla this morning 13/8. edd is 25/8 in chatswood.",
1287, app updated with estimated delivery overnight. so full details just incase it helps:  order: 01 march vehicle: m3 lr location: brisbane vin through chrome extension: 12 aug invoice: none yet estimated delivery: 20sep-30sep  anybody here with the same delivery estimate? i’m surprised the car is still 5-7 week away from delivery with all these ships.,
1288,"congrats to all those people who have received vins in the recent storm! very happy for you guys - and it gives the rest of us a sliver of hope that maybe ours is on the way too!  question for those who have received a vin and sms: how long is it normally between your app updating with a specific edd (eg. aug 17-31) and you getting an sms? reason being i was thinking of contacting the app developers and suggesting they add a push notification whenever the edd changes. would save me having to buy a new f5 key every month. if it turns out that we get an sms within an hour or so the the app updating, i won't bother checking it every 5 seconds. but if it's days in between, it's probably a feature most of us would appreciate? when i say most of us, i mean those people that can't just be chill and wait like an adult. i just am not that person and i make no apologies ",
1289,congrats! are the first 4 vin numbers of the last 6 : 6107xx?,
1290," congrats!, yours gives me hope that i may see a vin soon, but still need to check, could you please let us know what your build date is once you find out.",
1291,congrats! are the first 4 vin numbers of the last 6 : 6107xx? this will help determine reallocation or new production run before we get our build date. other recent rwd vins are 6103xx and 6106xx.,
1292,will do. still no vin ,
1293,yoooo vin gods you on smoko?,
1294,"question for victorians who’ve taken delivery or got their delivery texts, did your vin appear in the vicroads rego check or your vicroads account before you got the text? wondering if the car is registered before they book a delivery slot (and if so another website to keep checking )",
1295,"and also, that's just what, 1/5 of the total cars on the video? even if you have both my and m3, surely there will be more vin coming right? right???? ",
1296,"if you're worried, how do you think i feel?  i'm just very much in the barganing stage of tesla grief and convincing myself that they have to do a big push, greater than normal to clear out all of q1 orders. veda thinks thousands are still to come in q3 so i'm hoping that i'm one of them!  these vins are prgressing days too slowly for me to be confident though. for me to feel like i'm in this batch, i'd want to be seeing 20-30th of feb orders getting vins by the end of today or tomorrow.  when this vin storm quites, i'll move into acceptance stage of tesla grief that mine will come in q4.   i'm hoping to be surprised though ",
1297,"vin and invoice received overnight!!!! oder date 13/3/22 lr white/black delivery august-october  build date 12/8/22 location melbourne  vin ..614….  first time poster, long time reader…",
1298,not the vin storm i expected. but glad to see some peoples orders are being fulfilled.,
1299,i think they said it would be a careful ramp after the production line reopened. which i think only restarted about a week ago. i think you will get a vin in the next week.  does anyone know if there were any changes to the cars after the production line pause? or was it all just production line optimisation?,
1300," do you have a similar vin to mine which was issued overnight 6107xx? (we have the same config and location, i ordered one day later.)",
1301,with that date you should have a hidden vin too,
1302,"after my vin arrived yesterday, i got my edd update. originally aug - nov, now showing sep 21 - 30. which is exactly as i predicted as i'll be overseas until the 1st. ha.",
1303,updated edd overnight 14-28 september (from august-october) after vin and invoice friday night. order date 13 march. melbourne. excitement level just gone up! i’m thinking of doing a ceramic coating - should i?,
1304,so here's a thought ... the vin allocations recently are lr and p (as we know) and not many (hardly any) rwd. what motor is used in the rwd compared to the lr & p models? is there a supply issue at the plant with motors for the rwd? or am i overthinking this a bit?,
1305,i think they try to give you a week notice.  do you know where your car is? has it landed in australia (i.e. vin on the ) and when?  i have the same window but still no delivery scheduling sms for a brisbane pickup. the car landed 11 aug. i expect transit time to sydney would be shorter than to brisbane.  the terms in your order agreement give you 7 days to pick up from when they tell you the car will be available but realistically they need to have some flexibility to account for things like a covid isolation and people getting on with their lives in the face of indefinite delays. call them on monday and explain the situation to see what can be done.,
1306,"2 questions, 1/ has anyone who's car was unloaded yesterday at pk got their vin on the rav yet? 2/ from others experience, how long after being unloaded did it take to see your vin on the rav? thanks in advance",
1307,"my car is on the euphony ace that arrived in pk yesterday (still at dock now). my vin is not showing on the rav. govt website - maybe works govt hours....  or maybe the man with the clipboard has not got to mine yet.  i am not sure how it works but after waiting patiently (ish) for the last 8 months, i am now getting rather skittish - so close and yet so far. sometimes there could perhaps be much information - ignorance is bliss.",
1308,i read somewhere in this thread that the govt website updates at 12:30pm and 6:30pm. i’m assuming it’s weekday only. hope your vin shows up there tomorrow.,
1309,boat arrived monday and got vin showing on rav tuesday afternoon. sms re delivery/pick up date on thurs,
1310,"hi , welcome to the forum. its very likely that your long rang model 3 is on one of the 5 ships that have arrived in australia recently, so your wait is likely nearly over. some indication that your car is arriving is a request in your tesla app to accept the change to “vision only” autopilot, a vehicle identification number appearing in your tesla account and later an invoice for final payment.  this thread has more information on how to identify a hidden vin as well.  to post a message, go to the bottom of the relevant page and you will see the reply box similar to below.   ",
1311,welcome . do you have a vin yet?   when you want to post something without replying just go to the last post on a page and you should see your profile and next to that a spot to enter your question.,
1312,"you’ve ordered exactly a month after me. if everything goes to planned you might get yours a month after i get mine. but once you get a edd range ie 17-31 aug, thats when you’ll get super excited, vin may get to you early next month",
1313,impossible to tell. it happens somewhere between upon vin assignment the customer cancelling the order until around the week before delivery where tesla will call you wanting to know when you're going to make final payment. it's that last call that forces the issue.,
1314,"  this is a fantastic idea! why didn't  and i think of this...?   ...ohh that's bad news. right lads, lassies our ormaus needs kitty a lot more than we do, looks like.    alas, new information has come to light . ormaus is way too important to this thread/forum to risk being homeless! we need to call a truce right away.   awww...there's a good kitty, hope he's all happy and well now.   right everyone! this story arc is over - it's back to monitoring the vin barometer for incoming vin storms, ship tracking, drone fly-over watching  domestic china delivery watching, accessory & wall charger watching, 's and  blue nails watching, ,  and  drag watching (you guys make sure you send  them photos), who's the best insurance/finance watching and of course...multi-coloured forklift watching. actually, where the heck is  should we put up an amber alert for him? he went mia monitoring forklifts - or is he actually already organising mad-max style forklift derby thunderdome racing?  p.s. maybe i should simply beg  to come out of retirement and book me in for a session.  (edit, honourable mentions.)",
1315,"hi   while logged into your tesla account, open another tab in your browser and go here ...  this will show your rn number and other interesting stuff as well as your vin when it is issued.",
1316,"those who have received their m3 vin, quick question on the order that things happened in.  did the vin appear in source code before you had to accept the changes for tesla vision, or did you have to accept the changes for tesla vision before the vin appeared? and when did your edd adjust in relation to these?  figuring out what i should be refreshing on a daily basis while waiting haha",
1317,"i happened to be refreshing the api link and i noticed that the length of the url had changed. that’s when i noticed the vin had appeared. so, i didn’t have to accept the tesla vision change, even though that page was most likely open in another tab. the edd for me will be blank as i’ll be having my car trucked to wagga.",
1318,i hope your right man. keep us updated on domestic market. does anyone get any knews of europe vin allocation. be interested to see the split right now and what configs are gettiing assigned.,
1319,"not sure , could not find my vin on that web page.. i am assuming it was on the viking passama or morning crystal !",
1320,"my build date is 11-aug, received vin 12-aug, new build for sure.",
1321,"depends. am mid feb order, and my original date was not aug to nov, instead was ""5- 7 months from order date"" (aka mid july to mid sept).  app now shows aug to nov.  given no vin yet, am assuming it won't be sept, more likely oct/nov, so not within the first window but potentially in the second window.",
1322,think roro row your boat is the only one that seems to list vin onboard cargo but not sure,
1323,"my invoice got uploaded today, after receiving my vin on the weekend. exciting...",
1324,"thanks. i am sorry, i dont know what ship mine was on as i never did the ship track thing.  was too busy with the accessory research & acquisition, vin check, rav registry, finance, tesla sms's, sa management, forum f5'ing, mate management, youtube watching, charging trepidation avoidance, app loading and wifey sum-checking all above. (still have to get nails done blue apparently!)  i reckon it's easier to get a pilot's license.  but, yes, i think it was the viking passama.",
1325,"congratulations! i’m thinking our cars were built on the same day, could you please share the build date on your invoice?  my vin was also provided over the weekend but i’m still waiting for the invoice. edd was updated this morning 4-18 sep (was 16-30 sep).  cheers, stan",
1326,12th of august! which means my vin arrived about the day after the car was built. interesting.,
1327,out of curiosity - those with booking dates were you able to search your vin up on carways?  ,
1328,"checked the vin source code page early this morning (as i have done nearly daily for the last few weeks now) and nothing.  and now i've just received the ""review your model 3 invoice"" email! lo and behold, i now have a vin!  ...... and now it's the my i really want. so with the heaviest of hearts i'll soon have to cancel this and lose the $350. not game to take delivery, try to flip it and be blacklisted by elon. have already asked all my real relatives a few times if they want it!!  i know someone else will be more than happy to take it instead. please don't flame me, you will get my cancelled order soon enough ",
1329,"i just booked a delivery. the vin does not show in the carways search you linked, but i assume that only shows cars booked or currently in transit.",
1330,"just got my invoice, build date is also 12 aug. vin was provided just before midnight or 10pm local time on the same day. that’s fast vin allocation!",
1331,"i have the same window as you. no vin (even in chrome extension) as yet, a txt to say get my finance in order. i am bris also. m3p",
1332,"in the past vins were known to be assigned while on the water, that practice seems to have stopped recently unless a cancellation had occurred and it was reassigned to someone else while in transit. i think it's probably unlikely based on build dates reported by people who have recently got vins and they were built the day before the vin came through. we can only hope they will keep pumping them out for us to fill as many shipping places as they could secure to have as big a reporting quarter as possible.",
1333,i got a vin sms,
1334,strange. i’ve my invoice and vin. maybe your vin is just being held up with admin,
1335,i don’t think the chrome extension is reliable. i couldn’t see any vin in page source/chrome extension for 2 weeks. then someone here pointed to this api call. login to your account and then got this url and you should see the vin ,
1336,"my vin indicates it is an ""s"" motor which translates to a 3d7. shows up as 194kw in tesla's documentation . are they achieving different outputs between the model 3 and model y using software? could it have been that the original model y's which were brough into the country last year for adr compliance using the older 220kw 3d6 motors and this is what's on the aus gov records? who knows with tesla...",
1337,it's totally is a thing !!!!! especially because it's my sixmonthiversary as well (white/white though). lol!!!!  i sincerely hope you will get a vin today ....... because that also mean i might get mine as well ,
1338,which letters in the vin indicate motor?? is there a code deciphering link??,
1339,i'm 6 february and no vin - so if we're up to 5 february i should be next in line haha.  i'm not holding my breath - no cars will get to perth now in time to get within q3 for tesla's records.,
1340,"latest info from the : if you're still hanging around in this forum and you've received a vin - no matter if you've ordered a p, lr, or rwd - please jump on to the . every little piece of information counts, and sadly we will no longer have the wonderfully valuable efforts of  doing all the hard work for us.  also - if you've ordered more recently, and would like to  to get a sense of ordering habits here in australia, please don't hesitate!",
1341,"i just came back from tesla parramatta, went to see my sa, he confirmed that some rwd orders from february are being delivered, so i questioned him about why i haven't received my vin yet he said it all depend on configuration availability mine being white and black interior with 19 inch so ill receive my vin when tesla decide to build this combination. and this will work for all other orders. so hang in there and wait because orders are not build by order date instead of whats available in the build batches. which kind of sucks but nothing we can do.",
1342,"your order is 4 days after my order i bet you will receive your vin before mine, just because i have 19 inch rims.",
1343,"yes and no. got vin for one order. just like yourself, waiting on vin for the other order.",
1344,"that's what i'm referring to. you got a vin for a car ordered in march. others here ordered in feb and have nothing. i, myself ordered 13 days after you and i haven't heard anything. not having a vin for a car you ordered in june is hardly the same as someone who ordered 6 months ago.",
1345,i have a feeling my vin was a cancellation. so think adding it may muck up the system.,
1346,"the shipping process can jumble things too. take my  and : ordered 6 jan, same site, both lr, different paint, same build date, vin date, different ships dep 21/27 jul arriving 8/10 aug, cars delivered 17/19 aug.",
1347,"after getting my vin yesterday and accepting tesla vision, i just saw the final invoice and an edd of sep 7-21.  i'll cancel the order soon so it can go to the next person on the list...",
1348,i was randomly checking rav just now and my vin popped up on it .....does that mean i will be getting the delivery sms soon in couple of days??.....i am excited,
1349,"well the time has come fellow forklift enthusiasts. pick up is this saturday, my seven month prison sentence is coming to an end. it's been an amazing time here, switching between shipping updates, drone footage perusals, accessories conversations, charging conversations, being a member of the vin shower on one fateful friday evening and now, watching the second wave of upcoming model 3 owners whinging about not receiving theirs in four months. good luck to you all. but, what i can say, is that this experience has made me stronger, tougher, and my will to live the 'good things will come to those who wait' lifestyle' can now continue until cybertruck orders open once more in 2025. love yous all.....",
1350,"good to see rwd build date in aug, instead of a cancellation order. if they built rwd on 12/8, still doesn't explain no sign of vin rain!",
1351,it seems the vin gets on rav at the first port of entry. for ruby ace it'll be at fremantle. it's scheduled to dock in melbourne on friday. i would expect the smses next week.,
1352,"think historically larger vin allocations have happened on fri, sat and sun mornings which sort of lines up with these two ships. fingers and toes crossed for a big rwd vin dump this weekend",
1353,i have had three different people from my local tesla dealer tell me over the past week that my invoice is 'processing'. i was told last friday that it would be in my account by the next afternoon.i should keep an eye out for it. yesterday i was informed the they has just double-checked and it is 'processing'. keep an eye out for it. has anyone else experienced this type of drawn out process for receiving your invoice? it is getting onto two weeks since i was given the vin and rego papers but it is the insistence that 'all is good and it is processing' that i am finding strange - or is it normal?,
1354,still waiting for my lr in melbourne. mid december order. the vin was entered in rav on 9/8. not a peep yet from tesla. very frustrating seeing all the model ys getting delivered still.,
1355,soo someone of fb just got a vin rwd 12/2 what is going on?,
1356,"so, this is it. my pick up is tomorrow at 3pm.  when i bought the car in february, i was absolutely thrilled. i was given the edd of 14-20 weeks and i could not stop watching youtube videos, reading articles about the car, trying to find anything about how the delivery & pick up process works, etc, etc. i then came across this forum in april and decided to sign up instantly. i hadn't talked on this for some time until i had a question and this community was so nice to answer it so quickly and easily and i just felt so comfortable.  the wait ended up being way longer than 14-20 weeks, however, my life has completely changed after joining this forum back in april. i actually don't know what i would've done for the 6 or so months of waiting without the existence of this forum.   i've learnt so many things, such as stalking ship arrival times on armacup, how to figure out whether you got your vin assigned in the source code, checking your vin on the rav to see whether the car has been registered, etc.  the ones who are ordering now or have ordered recently, enjoy the ride. enjoy the community that this forum brings and enjoy the wait for one of the most exciting cars in the market. i've heard some people say that once you receive that car, you forget about the wait, which i can already agree with because i haven't been able to sleep properly knowing that i am going to be a soon-to-be tesla owner.  i love you guys. thank you for the memories. thank you  for your vin allocation tables and everyone for putting in the work and helping each other out. tmc on top. tesla on top.  see you guys on the road.  love, centrals",
1357,"congrats!!! its getting close. i am so confused with tesla building structure. i understand its on config its just all over the place. you see some people with the same config but earlier not have a vin some do. its weird. but maybe they are still building oz. maybe they arent doing there first half international, second half domestic. these are different times. so many more ships then usual.   come on love to us standard configs",
1358,"i'm pretty sure the last major vin shower happened on a monday, tuesday & wednesday in july. i only remember because it was during my snow holiday and when i got off the mountain i had something like 14 pages of forum to go through. that was when it started as a flood of vehicles for wa and moved over to the east coast.",
1359,so when you receive the vin does that mean that the car has just been made? also did you see the vin in the tesla app or by using that coding stuff?,
1360,"i never found out until pickup, despite making a request for it. most insurances should let you take out a policy online with just a vin though, and ask you to put the plate number in as soon as you find out afterwards.",
1361,"now would be a nice time for a post saying just one more rwd vin has been received, with a build date within a 5 day period.",
1362,dang. sorry to hear that. this whole process is a strange journey where now i’m super relieved to have a vin but also feel really bad for those just on the cusp of getting on because i was there last week. hang in there!,
1363,"as i said earlier, i got a call yesterday to say car is ready. just checked my account page. no surprise   sa said, payments are in and rego papers processed check qld rego status: vin not found  no wonder my confidence levels are low.",
1364,stupidly optimistic that rwd orders built yesterday/today with no vin notifications maybe possibly hopefully could sneak onto the paganella. don't know why i keep doing this to myself....,
1365,its all i can think about right now. we have about a week to get a vin or it will be next q,
1366,not necessarily. it could also mean the production volume is up too. m3 vin allocation after upgrade seems to lag for 3 days therefore there's no need to panic now.  if we have not heard any massive rwd vin allocation before friday next week. we have to lower our expectation to receive the cars in november.,
1367,we  we have one ship leaving monday and another sunday  if we don’t get a vin this weekend of next week we aren’t getting a car this q. looking more and more likely,
1368,"there is a p vin for 26th of march.  it's frustrating, but also there are much fewer of them than rwd so the order days will fly past quicker.  if they made 500 rwd in this vin drop on the week and 500 lr and p orders than the rwd orders would only span a few days (as we saw, we only had 7-8 order days fulfilled) and it could be 1.5 months worth of lr and p orders.  it is annoying to know that if i forked out $30k extra i would have a vin right now, but i know my car will come at some point. the wait isn't bothering me too much, it's just the uncertainty.",
1369,i received the “get ready” sms this morning.  been on hold for two hours with cba to increase my daily payment limit.  my car was on the euphony ace ship. the  tracking website still doesn’t show my car’s vin as trucked yet.,
1370, on earth as in hea-vin. give us today our daily bread. forgive us our vins as we forgive those who vin against us   oh this can just keep going,
1371,"fyi my timeline/observations  white/blk syd rwd (alexandria) 23 jan order date (14-20 weeks) 17 july status updated with edd aug 26 to sep 5 13 august - euphony ace docked 15 august - showed up on rav 18 august status updated with edd of aug 18 - sep1, then later that day 1st sms, then 2 hours later received schedule delivery sms picking up 24 august.  was able to track my vin on  (but might not work for the armacup ships, i was on euphony ace)  people with chatswood and miranda pick ups on the same ship appear to have gotten their sms's a bit earlier - 2 days ago for a monday pick up. the people i know also did not receive a first sms from what i can tell.  waits almost over for me - hope the above helps kerb the inexplicable/irrational anxiety that i experienced while waiting!!",
1372,3rd feb rwd white on black got a vin on facebook group  is it finally time for our standards to get a turn,
1373,so vin bonanza? let’s wait and see . it is friday after all,
1374,"if that's the one i saw, i'm not so sure. i asked build date and they said ""built after/around nov 2021 as a 2022 model year"". then asked if it was bad to post vin online. i said if they were concerned about safety, best not to ask a stranger online ",
1375,"last time i saw an armacup schedule posted here, there was paganella arriving shanghai 16/8 and morning cherry 21/8. is that still the case? - fingers crossed for a vin storm…",
1376,"i’m hoping it’s paganella as mine is a build date of 12/8 and vin 13/8. however, i’m only hoping and guessing",
1377,"*** speculation alert ***  weekly speculation time.  the quarterly model 3 reservation is close to 5000. out of this number, the rwd quantity is about 4250. tesla has already delivered the entire january rwd therefore  are to be manufactured to fulfil all rwd orders up to 15/03/2022 (before the delivery timeframe changed on the 15th of march).  let's assume tesla could reach to 60% of their claimed peak of 1000 per day capacity after the upgrade, for the australian market. that's 600 model 3s a day.  it would require 3.5 days to manufacture what's required to fulfil all q1 orders before the delivery timeframe changed on the 15th of march.  possible ships available according to today's schedule:   i would imagine the majority of m3 waiters would have to agree that according to the 3.5 days projection, it is less likely manufacturing would be in time for morning cherry to carry all these model 3s (not 100% as vin allocation is lagged at this time).  then all eyes are on morning crystal. unfortunately, i have already seen some vin allocated for model y's that are to be delivered on the 15th -30th of september and i could only hope the vin allocation for model ys and model 3s are working in a different way.  conclusion? no conclusion.  *** end speculation alert ***",

1380,mines a week since vin and no invoice yet. not sure but delay might just be because its possibly the biggest chunk of teslas heading our way yet. where did you see the 'still processing' message?,

1384,had nothing better to do as there appears to be a vin drought for rwd orders from q1 so went to tesla us to see wait times for their m3 rwd which drive away is just over $70k aud so roughly the same and order now edd october to december...  rwd march 12 order,
1385,"latest update from me: the vin assigned to me was definitely a cancellation (finance fell through). between wed 17/08 and now, i've made the full payment and they wanted me to pick up the car last night, but unfortunately due to work commitments i've been unable to. i've scheduled to take delivery on monday the 22nd of august  happy to upload some pics when i get it.  damn i'm so excited to drive this car!",
1386," this has probably happened to me 3 times now:  1. hear that more shanghai rhd cars are being made 2. get excited and start refreshing the tesla app hoping for the ""tesla vision"" prompt or a vin on the website 3. pray to the tesla gods that i will be in this batch 4. get disappointed when i find no vin and that the cars are either all allocated or are going to europe / japan.  starting to get real stale at this point, so i really need to try and forget about this and distract myself with other things- but it's so damn hard to do!",
1387,"small consolation, but at least tesla appear to be making inroads into the backlog. for a while there it seemed like the backlog was just going to keep growing, with shanghai lockdowns and talk of ongoing supplier shortages.   hang in there. it's a great day when the vin turns up, then you get to ship guessing and annoyance with waiting outside port and from there it's waiting for pickup message and getting frustrated with that (i'm at this stage and starting to stress about whether we'll get it before going overseas).",
1388,"making inroads? may be for lr and p, definitely not for rwd with only about a month (jan and some early feb) orders got cleared in last 5 months... backlog for rwd is definitely growing with every passing month without vin storm",
1389,"hi all,  ordered a rwd black/black on 13th feb and still waiting for vin. we have our financing with macquarie locked in at 2.99% till 29th august. starting to think that receiving a vin this week is very unlikely. was wondering if anyone on this forum had any guidance on how to get the finance through prior to getting the car? or recommend any steps i could take with another finance provider?",
1390,"sorry to be the barer of bad news but the bank won't finalise the loan until the day the car is collected. even if you get a vin tomorrow, the finance will still expire on the 29th and you'll need to reapply.   as far as i can tell, for us here in adelaide the car will still be 5-8 weeks away from the date you get the vin. my finance expires in january, so i'm looking for a vin by mid november at the latest or else i'll be paying a really high interest rate.",
1391,with macquarie they allowed me to finalise my loan with them at 2.99 with just my vin number. i had to agree to stay the repayments without the car actually being here. so loan finalised on 9 aug and pick up car on 24 aug.,
1392,can i ask if you needed an invoice or just a vin?  i’m with plenti and it runs out on 15th october  i don’t see me getting my car before then but i do expect my vin by then so just wondering,
1393,"the good ship paganella is on its way to brisbane with eta 3rd sept. i'm guessing filled with a bunch of aussie model 3s and ys.  with a vin release 12th aug, reckon my car is on this ship? tesla app says 20-30th sept edd.",
1394,"day 259...  so: i have had no contact from tesla since i received my vin last month. vin searches on the rav website and qld rego app are still not returning any hits.  however: my sa phoned today and asked whether i had recemtly received an sms from tesla. (last one i had received was the 'welcome' text in december) apparently my car is arriving in brisbane this week!! arranged pickup for next tuesday over the phone and app reflected the change a few minutes later.   ""i've been patient, heaven knows"" ",
1395,"no offence, but i doubt you care if anyone is offended. just like you, we're allowed to voice our opinion here. some who ordered their car before you may still be waiting for their vin long after you're driving your nice new car, so your no-offence comment may only frustrate further. sure, there's other, larger issues in the world however this forum is for those waiting on their teslas; feel free to discuss other, more important issues elsewhere.",
1396,i’ll probably be like this when i get my vin too.,
1397,**** breaking news ****  many chinese model 3 buyers received vin allocation today.  gg ladies and gentlemen.,
1398,"i got really close to cancelling, except my wife was more resilient. then excitement rebuilt when i got my vin 16th july, and then the delivery call. disillusionment came back with a rush when we were only allowed 1 day and a half to collect. until i reminded then we live 750kn away, and they were to deliver to home. agreement reached, and they again established a delivery this week. arranged insurance etc. and waited for final call. yep. delivery is now scheduled for september 6th. tried to revoke the home delivery, but that a no-go either because transport was already booked. separately, we sought to gain info about powerwall through our account. got an acknowledgement of enquiry - then nothing, for now 3 months. seriously disillusioned with tesla tbh.",
1399,those who have received their cars... typically how long was it from receiving your vin to actually taking delivery of the vehicle?,
1400,16-jul vin received - 30-aug collection for me. i think there were a couple on here with same build date who got a collection a week or so before me. i'm melbourne so that would add a good few days over a sydney order.,
1401,  i'm in bne and my edd is 3-17 and vin date is only a day ahead of yours.. so i don't see why yours would not arrive in the same boat and therefore same delivery window. my edd was same as yours but got pushed forward shortly after.   i'm guessing my pick up date will be either 1st or 2nd week of september.,
1402,"i noticed a few cars there have vin date that is in the future and even past delivery date, so there may be some discrepancies.",
1403,"thanks  .   based on your message i decided to speak with my sa today (will be sydney collection) and asked if there was any further update on my estimated delivery dates being shown on app which is sept 7 - sept 22. i was not sure if that would even be possible to meet that timeframe because i have not yet received a vin.   he said that his system shows that its due to be delivered to their showroom on sept 13 and that it all looks on track and that its not a worry that the vin isn't showing yet and that it will show on the final invoice.   so any sydney collection people with a similar estimate delivery date to mine... might be good news that the estimate is correct?  order date: 14/3 spec: m3 long range, black, 19inch sports rims, black interior, no self drive",
1404,"i've got a similar edd and tesla have been chasing me for the signed rego papers. i'm puzzled that you don't have a vin yet he claims that it will be delivered on the 13th september - how does he know what ""it"" is? the car would obviously need to have been built by now, so why can't they tell you the vin with the same certainty as when it'll arrive?",
1405,"congrats and take a deep breath. first, pay tesla. organise your insurance with your vin (you might have to call as this option isn't on some websites but they do it) you won't get your rego until near the pickup. yes, the shed painting, you might have to do some overtime for a few nights  seriously though enjoy. you're a lucky person ",
1406,"i've made similar comments recently. waiting 5 months for a vin and around 6 to receiving your car, compared to the oldest outstanding rwd orders, then suggesting ""it's worth the wait"" is kinda a red rag to a bull.   i'm genuinely happy for those who are picking up their cars and i look forward to that excitement, but right now staring down what looks like an 8 month wait is frustrating.",
1407," 16/03 and no vin assigned here yet, hope to see something soon but very much looking like wont be making it in this run if danny's info to be believed *twiddles thumbs",
1408,another feb order here… i needed my car to arrive before november 1 to keep my 2.99% finance with macquarie. looks like that ain’t going to happen now. only hope is a vin sometime in october and possible start of finance early. pretty disappointing…,
1409,"don't know why, but it feels quieter now on the vin front than during the covid and plant upgrade periods. we don't even get drone videos of the shanghai plant or dock any-longer.  popped into the parramatta dealership last week for the heck of it. sa assured me that i will receive the vehicle this side of xmas. 18/03 order, app showing 6-9 mouths.   ",
1410,"ok here's a thought. if tesla build to and deliver the quarter and i don't have a vin yet (i ordered 5.5 months ago) , whats the bet i'm in the next quarter (dec)?     m3 - rwd - white on black - all std - od 15/3/2022 - edd 6-9 months - no vin",
1411,"hi folks ... what a great morning it is ... i have a vin    it must have only just been pushed to my account as i checked earlier this morning and there were no changes. checking again around 9:30am aest i received the ""go to you account message to accept a change"" on my cellphone. i suspect it's likely a cancellation. i don't have a build date as yet.  for other q1 rwd'ers - check your order status!",
1412,"in in a similar boat to yours. my edd is same as yours and i will be not be able to accept the car at least until late january or start of my edd if they decide to bring the date forward. though looking at the way the queue currently is, i doubt they will be able to bring it forward much anyways unless they suddenly manage to ramp up the berlin factory for eu deliveries and that frees up capacity from shanghai.   i would also be interested to know how the queue system works if you cannot accept the delivery when they first offer it. will you just be swapping the spot with the next person who does not have vin or will you be pushed further down the queue or back to the end? of how much can you just push back the pickup time if you want to keep that specific car? i understand they don't want to push it to next quarter, but inside the same quarter it will not affect their reporting?",
1413,"long time lucker! nice to see you all, just got a vin & estimated delivery date, i ordered a blue rwd on 4th feb 2022 ",
1414,"is it possible  had a hidden vin assigned the same day you did, but didn't know how to find it?  and now it's showing directly on the app.",
1415,"hmm weird, i just emailed my sa also (overseas till friday) so can't call. i'll see what he says and let you know if i hear anything different. slightly worrying as i would have expected to have the invoice by now as it's been about 2weeks since vin sms came through.",
1416,"my date updated overnight from 22nd sep to 1 september to 15 september - canberra. i have invoice and vin etc. but i can not see the vin on revs, what does that mean?",
1417,"i changed colour of a y order after vin was assigned, and got a new vin within a few weeks. not sure if you could do that twice and keep getting away with it but worth a try maybe ",
1418,yeah… here’s hoping we get a vin sometime in october so we can start finance early,
1419,"same initial delivery, with the same push back to tomorrow. you're 11am? i  12noon.  received some disappointing (in one way) yet positive experience (in another) news just now from the mulgrave delivery centre.  my car has not met the high standards of the readying team as there are some paint defects. they are sending it to the service centre on my behalf to get resolved in the next 5-7 working days. anticipating at delivery all aspects will be flawless.  edd pushed back to saturday 10th sept.  supposedly they are doing ~100 deliveries per day at the moment.   [m3lr white/white. od 6-jan-22. build 15-jul-22, vin 16-jul-22. edd revised bookings 29/8; 1/9; 10/9]",
1420,or possibly last week of sep. last quarter tesla changed production from domestic to export in the last week of quarter (there were lot of late june build date in rwd) as they cannot clear the domestic production within a week. turandot is due at shanghai on 26/9 (likely 1-2 days delay due to usual port traffic). so there is a possibility you may get vin just before the calendar turns over to oct.,
1421,"agree that they are done for the quarter. but if your assumption of mid/late oct for vin is based on 'export production at the start of the quarter', then it is not as simple. it is 'start of the quarter + a ship nearby'. they wouldn't want to have the storage yard filled with cars waiting for a ship. so it will most likely vin around 26/9 when turandot is arriving in shanghai or whenever the first ship for au arriving in shanghai in oct.",
1422,"so with an edd of now to 15 september, invoiced and rego forms provided, vin not appearing on vehicle register…think vehicle is in australia or on the water? tesla tells me they can see it is ‘in transit’ but not where it is. feels kind of like it is still on a boat but not far from shore…",
1423,"yep, seems to be a backlog. my car is supposed to be on paglia but no vin in rav yet. edd still 31 aug - 6 sept.",
1424,"as per my earlier post, 'start of the quarter' is actually last week of the previous quarter. last vin storm for rwd was in end of june. build on 27/6 and 28/6, with vin received by 2/7. turandot is still a posibility. late oct and early november would be correct for edd, but i was referring to vin arriving possibly last few days of sep or early oct.",
1425,"i was expecting delivery in december and a vin next month, ordered in mid-march, so had no finance arranged due to the 3 month validity.  yesterday i received a call from my sa to say they have matched a vehicle, it is in adelaide and ready to pickup next week - time to make some calls!  ps: i now have a 2018 ms 75d for sale, immediate delivery available; i'll post an ad sometime this weekend with photos etc. please dm me if you're actually interested.",
1426,"just looking at the difference between the m3rwd and the m3lr, i am thinking i should upgrade to the long range if that falls under the limit for the new fbt leasing policy on evs. according to the comments elsewhere, it does if i only get paint and nothing else added on? would i be able to upgrade my existing order at any time before a vin is assigned (my window is march-may of 2023).  thanks",
1427,thanks mate. am i able to change my order at any time before a vin is assigned?,
1428,ordered at the end of feb (3 lr) and have a vin and edd of sep 10th. seems the latest batch with lr and p (and the batch before was the base rwd). so im sure the next one will be rwd,
1429,"exact same thing happened to me, not sure what it means yet, hard to say really until the vin at least shows up in rav.",
1430,"interestingly, my vin is still in the source code but now it is no longer showing up in the api call. is it possible that i am getting a cancelled order and the vin will change?  vin i have in the page source won't come up in rav.",
1431,"it happened to me too, exactly the same. vin appeared in api call when it was first allocated and remained so for a few days. then it disappeared from the api call, everything else seemed the same, rn etc, but no vin. oh no <insert a different word here instead of ""no"", maybe starting with ""f"">, i thought!  then strangely it reappeared. maybe it was the next day, i'm not really sure. but it did have me worried for a bit.  however, all was good. i picked up my new toy yesterday in mulgrave. the tesla team at mulgrave were terrific and very helpful. they had absolutely no issue with us staying in the delivery centre as long as we liked to check over the vehicle. to be honest, 2/3 of the way thru the check list i just wanted to hit the road as i found no deal breakers and just wanted to drive this thing!  i'm not going to say ""it was worth the wait"" as others have previously said 'cos i know that's no consolation for those still waiting ... oh, wtf ... it's worth the wait ",
1432,"nice one! and congrats on picking up the new wheels, i've had thoughts about painstakingly going through the checklist as well and thinking about rushing it just to get in and go for a cruise haha.  thanks for the info regarding the vin in the api and source etc. i was a little concerned when that happened. but i guess its all under control. waiting for the text to organise the delivery day now despite already being half way through the small estimated delivery window.",
1433,"tesla neither confirm or deny these things, but it's a fair bet it was a cancellation. between vin notification and delivery day, i had 3 business days to sort out finance and vicroads. it was a bit of a rush but we managed to get across the finish line.",
1434,"hi all - we have m3lr midnight silver on order - od early march, received the final invoice and rego docs in mid august, the expected dd in the app was something like 17th-26 september, location brisbane. since then the dd has changed several times, up until last week latest dd in the app stated 25th aug - 7th sept changing each day by 1. on friday checked the app again and dd is blank, all documents are gone, no vin in source code - logged into account the tesla website hoping it was just an app issue but is same there, no docs no vin, just states prepare for delivery and delivery date tba 🫥  anyone who expecting delivery very soon seeing same issues?   was happy to see the dd move forward as we are overseas in mid september - in middle of sorting the finance out and now seemingly can’t progress this without the documentation. not knowing when they expect us to actually collect the car with constant changing dates is stressful. have reached out to sa no response yet",
1435,   i received this text just a few minutes ago but still havent received an invoice and the vin is in the source code but not visibly showing on my account page.  from recieving this text to invoices and vins becoming visible on the account page how long did it take for others?  edd 8-22nd sept,
1436,"same sms received today. same delivery window. i found my vin on invoice, can't see it on web or app. i did find vin using the json link. not sure of any other way to see it.",
1437,i believe the stamp duty exemption will just be shown on the invoice once its uploaded. glad to hear another person with the same edd is at the same stage as me. i was feeling a bit worried that the day was getting closer and no visible vin or invoice had appeared. my sa said its all good but they dont fill me with a ton of confidence ,
1438,"come tesla please throw me a freaking bone.  from the info above (re vin & build dates) surely my car would also be in the country?  send me a text, an email or a punch to the face...anything!  i'm now regretting not asking to pick it up in sydney.",
1439,"hey guys! needed some advice.  so i purchased a blue tesla 16/2 and still haven't gotten a vin and my finance expires end of oct. i'm somewhat optimistic of getting a vin by end of sept and hopefully delivery before my finance expires. however, i just found out there's a used car being sold at 5.99% interest rate for finance that comes with enhanced auto pilot and heated front and rear seats (i think this is not available on my current order unless i purchase?)  the colour is different, but i was choosing between grey and blue anyways so i don't really care much about that. my worry is, is it worth to buy a used tesla (less than 5,000km odometer) or should i just wait for my actual car? is it also wrong to buy a used car? i've read a lot of heat going towards people that have sold/selling/purchased a used one.   my only issue is i need another car, but could realistically maybe wait it out till oct/nov, and there is always the possibility i will have to refinance when i get my actual car which i don't know when i will get.   should i just wait or go for it?",
